// rootLong is `vertra --help`'s introduction.
const rootLong = `vertra installs and operates Vertra: on your machine (kind), Google Cloud,
AWS, or a Kubernetes cluster you already have.

  vertra init dev          ask the questions, write deploy/dev/vertra.yaml
  vertra apply dev         show what it will create and cost; on approval, do it
  vertra console dev       open the console at http://localhost:18080

Each environment is a folder, deploy/<env>/ (or --config, or VERTRA_CONFIG),
holding vertra.yaml: its settings, names and references only, never a
secret. A command's [env] can be left out when there's only one.

Nothing in the cloud or the cluster changes until you approve apply's
screen (or pass --yes). Change a setting with ` + "`vertra config set`" + `, then apply;
` + "`vertra help settings`" + ` explains each one, ` + "`vertra help sizes`" + ` what each size is.

Guides: docs/setup.md (installing), docs/operations.md (running it).`

// rootExample is `vertra --help`'s examples.
const rootExample = `  vertra init dev && vertra apply dev
  vertra config set -e dev size resilient && vertra apply dev
  vertra help settings`

// help is each command's longer description and examples, by its path
// (applied to the tree by withHelp; a test keeps every command covered).

up: where (kind, gcp, aws, existing), the size, sleeping when idle, the
database (in-cluster, or managed: Cloud SQL, Amazon RDS), the first admin,
the console's address, the catalog, and what else it keeps and serves.
It checks the tools and your sign-in to the cloud, then writes
deploy/<env>/vertra.yaml. Nothing is created until ` + "`vertra apply`" + `.

Every question has a flag, so with --non-interactive the flags and
defaults answer. --force replaces an environment's settings.`,

  vertra init dev --non-interactive --target kind --admin-email admin@example.com`,

delete in the cloud and the cluster, what it builds and installs, and an
estimate of the monthly cost (gcp: your billing account's prices when you
may read them; otherwise list prices, and it says which). Nothing happens
until you approve. Then it creates the cloud side (OpenTofu), readies the
cluster and installs or upgrades both charts. Run it again after any
change: it makes the install match vertra.yaml, and does nothing more
when it already does. The approved screen is saved as last-plan.txt.`,

  vertra apply dev --yes           # no question (CI, scripts)`,

platform's Deployments and how many of its copies are ready, and whether
it's asleep. On an existing cluster with a public console, it also checks

unless --force. ` + "`vertra wake`" + ` brings it back; with scaleDown on, it also sleeps by
itself when idle (scaleDown.idleAfter) or at scaleDown.schedule. A
managed database keeps running (and billing) while asleep.`,

everything the module made. It asks about each kind of data first (the
database, its backups, logs, the registry), keeping whatever you say;
--all deletes them too. A kept managed database keeps its network. The
audit log's write-once copy is always kept. The environment's folder stays.`,

commit) as an OCI artifact, signed when the install requires it; each
install's console pulls and applies it, refusing one it can't verify when
it trusts a signer.`,
		example: `  ./vertra catalog release`,
	},
	"vertra catalog promote": {
		long: `Makes a version (vX.Y.Z) of the release main published for a commit, for
installs that follow versions (catalogVersion: newest, or a pinned one).`,

the same bytes. --update re-pins to what each tag names now.`,

scans the copy (reported, not blocking: a product's own scan blocks), and
signs it when the catalog signs. Products then build FROM the copy
(` + "`bases --use-mirror`" + `) rather than a public registry.`,

console enforces when it applies them (which store kinds and identities a
team may use, and that no identity is two teams'), so a pull request finds
out before a release refuses the file.`,

  ./vertra catalog secret-stores check web`,
