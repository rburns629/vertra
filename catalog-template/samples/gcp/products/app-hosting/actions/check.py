"""gcp/app-hosting's "check" action: whether it's ready on this install
(product.yaml's check). Changes nothing.

Run by the console with no inputs, as this product's identity. It asks
Google for a token as that identity (impersonating gcp-target when the
team's secret is mounted, as create does), then asks, with
testIamPermissions, whether it may deploy and delete Cloud Run services in
a project it can see, and act as that project's default compute service
account, which a service create deploys runs as. create's projectId is per
run, so it looks for any project: ready means there's at least one.
Reports what's missing as the roles to grant (the gcp team's README.md,
Credentials).

Resource Manager and IAM are called over REST (this image has no client
library for them): an AuthorizedSession, which adds the token to each
request itself.
