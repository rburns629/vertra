"""gcp/cloud-sql's "create" action: looks up a Cloud SQL instance by name
within a project, creating it (and waiting for the real, long-running
provisioning operation to finish) only if it doesn't already exist.


Run directly by this product's entrypoint.sh, which already guarantees this
script only ever runs for action="create" -- see product.yaml for this
action's declared input/output schema.

Unlike gcp/_project and gcp/app-hosting, the Cloud SQL Admin API has no
dedicated GAPIC client library (no `google.cloud.sql_v1`) -- Google's own
documentation points at the generic, discovery-based
`googleapiclient.discovery` client instead (the same "sqladmin" v1 service
every official Cloud SQL admin-api doc uses), so this file uses that
instead of `google.cloud.*`.

By default, calls the Cloud SQL Admin API using whatever
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS/ADC the container finds. If
the gcp-target secret is mounted, those base credentials are never used to
call GCP APIs directly -- they're only the *source* identity used to
impersonate that service account instead. See gcp/_project's own
create.py and catalog/README.md for the full reasoning (identical pattern,
copied rather than shared -- see the gcp team's README.md on why products don't
share code).
