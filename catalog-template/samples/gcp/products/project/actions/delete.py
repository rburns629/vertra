"""gcp/project's "delete" action: shuts down a project create made (its
cleanup). Given {"resource": {"type": "gcp/project", "id": ...}} as the
console recorded it.

Only a project carrying create's vertra-made label is deleted: a project
made some other way is refused, whoever asks. One already gone, or already
shutting down, succeeds: a cleanup must, when there's nothing left to do.
Google keeps a shut-down project for 30 days, when it can be restored.
