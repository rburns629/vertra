"""gcp/project's "create" action: looks up a GCP project by id, creating it
(and linking billing) only if it doesn't already exist.


Run directly by this product's entrypoint.sh, which already guarantees this
script only ever runs for action="create" -- see product.yaml for this
action's declared input/output schema.

By default, calls Resource Manager and (when creating a new project) Cloud
Billing using whatever GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS/ADC the container
finds. If the gcp-target secret is mounted, those base credentials are
never used to call GCP APIs directly -- they're only the *source* identity
used to impersonate that service account instead (short-lived tokens,
minted on demand; no static key for the target identity ever exists). The
source identity must itself hold roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator on
the target service account, and the target service account needs its own
IAM grants on whatever it's actually asked to do -- see the gcp team's README.md.
