# Operations

Installing, upgrading and running Vertra: on your machine with `kind`, and
on a cloud cluster. For how it works, see [architecture.md](architecture.md);
for what it enforces, [security-model.md](security-model.md).

`vertra`, the installer, does the cloud setup, the install and the catalog
repository in one place: [Setting up Vertra](setup.md). This page is what it
does underneath, and how to do it by hand: `make` targets on `kind` while
working on Vertra itself, and the Helm charts directly anywhere else. Either
way, the charts are complete on their own: `helm install` creates both
databases, generates their passwords and creates the first admin. Every
chart setting, with its default, is in the charts' `values.yaml`
(`helm/charts/execution-kernel/`, `helm/charts/execution-console/`).

## Local install with kind

Needs Docker (running), `kind`, `kubectl`, `helm` and `curl`.

```
make quickstart    # from nothing (or any state) to a running install; safe to re-run
```

It creates the `kind` cluster `vertra-local` and a local registry
(`localhost:5001`, where task images live), builds both platform images,
installs both charts into `vertra-system` with `helm/values/kind/*.yaml`,
creates the team `team-a`, and port-forwards the console to
http://localhost:18080. Sign in as `admin@example.com` / `vertra-local`:
that password is set only in the kind values, for a cluster nobody else can
reach. Never use it anywhere else.

Every day:

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `make up` | Resumes the node, clears Pods stuck as Unknown, port-forwards the console |
| `make down` | Stops the node and keeps everything (never `kind delete cluster` unless you mean to start over) |
| `make logs` | Tails kernel-api, the scheduler and the console together |
| `make catalog-publish` | Publishes `catalog-template/` with its `local` sample team (one product in five languages); `CATALOG=<folder>` publishes your own catalog, `SAMPLES=` other samples |
| `make kind-deploy` | Rebuilds both platform images and upgrades both releases (`kind-deploy-kernel`, `kind-deploy-console` for one) |
| `make test` | Starts a throwaway Postgres on `127.0.0.1:55432` and runs both projects' tests |

To try it: publish the samples, then paste the DAG from
`catalog-template/samples/local/README.md` into **Executions → Submit new**.
Each step is the same product in another language, chained with
`$fromTask`; the detail page follows it live.

## Installing on a cluster with Helm

Needs Kubernetes 1.30 or later, Helm 4, and a CNI that enforces
NetworkPolicy (GKE Dataplane V2, which Autopilot always has; on EKS the
VPC CNI's network policy agent, off until asked for: `vertra` turns it on,
and on a cluster of your own set the `vpc-cni` add-on's
`{"enableNetworkPolicy": "true"}`, or in Auto Mode the `kube-system`
ConfigMap `amazon-vpc-cni` with `enable-network-policy-controller: "true"`;
on AKS a network policy engine). Without it, no policy below holds.

1. **Images and charts.** Each release publishes both images (amd64 and
   arm64, scanned, signed keyless by the release workflow) and both charts
   to `ghcr.io/rburns629/vertra`, and the charts default to the images
   released with them: install from
   `oci://ghcr.io/rburns629/vertra/charts/execution-kernel` and
   `…/execution-console` with `--version <release>`. To run your own build
   instead, push `kernel/` and `console/` to your registry and set
   `image.repository` and `image.tag` (or `image.digest`).
2. **The platform namespace**, e.g. `vertra-system`. It's never a team's:
   the kernel's dispatch policy refuses to run steps in it. Keep who may
   create Pods there to administrators (NetworkPolicies trust its labels).
3. **Optional components**, before the charts that use them:
   - **Image signatures:** Sigstore's policy-controller
     (`helm/values/gke/policy-controller.yaml` is an example; it must exclude
     the platform namespace), then the kernel's `imageSignature` values.
   - **Syncing secrets from a vault:** External Secrets Operator
     (`helm repo add external-secrets https://charts.external-secrets.io`;
     `vertra config set externalSecrets true` has `vertra apply` install it,
     pinned). On EKS a team's store signs in by IRSA, which needs the
     cluster's OIDC issuer registered in IAM: `vertra` does that for a
     cluster it makes; the Team page's guide has the command otherwise.
     EKS Pod Identity doesn't work for a store.
4. **Values.** Copy `helm/values/gke/` (or `kind/`) as a starting point;
   each file's comments say what its settings are for, and every setting is
   documented in the charts' `values.yaml`. The files are the whole of an
   environment's settings: deploy with `--reset-values`, so nothing set by
   hand lingers. At minimum: the image source tasks may use
   (`imagePolicy.sourceRegistry`), the console's `kernelApiUrl`
   (`http://<kernel release>-execution-kernel-api.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:8000`),
   and the first admin's email.
5. **Install**, kernel first, with a size preset under your values (see
   [Sizes, sleeping and headroom](#sizes-sleeping-and-headroom)). Not
   `--wait` on a first install: each chart migrates its database in a
   post-install hook, which Helm runs only after `--wait` sees every Pod
   ready, and the console isn't ready until its tables exist. Helm still
   waits for the hook; wait for the rollout after it.

   ```
   CHARTS=oci://ghcr.io/rburns629/vertra/charts; V=<release, e.g. 0.1.0>; SIZE=minimal
   helm pull $CHARTS/execution-kernel --version $V --untar; helm pull $CHARTS/execution-console --version $V --untar
   helm install kernel ./execution-kernel -n vertra-system -f execution-kernel/sizes/$SIZE.yaml -f <values>/kernel.yaml
   helm install console ./execution-console -n vertra-system -f execution-console/sizes/$SIZE.yaml -f <values>/console.yaml
   kubectl -n vertra-system rollout status deployment -l 'app.kubernetes.io/instance in (kernel,console)'
   kubectl -n vertra-system logs job/console-execution-console-migrate   # the first admin's password, shown once; changed at the first sign-in
   ```

   Upgrades (`helm upgrade`) can use `--wait`: they migrate before the
   rollout.

6. **Reach the console** with `kubectl port-forward svc/console-execution-console 18080:8080`,
   or over HTTPS (next section) before anyone signs in over a network.
   kernel-api must stay `ClusterIP`.
7. **Sign in, change the password**, and on the Admin page: add admins,
   mint the catalog's automation token, and set the allowed image sources.
   Keep the first admin's account. Every install and upgrade creates an
   admin with `bootstrapAdmin.email` if no account has that email, so if
   you delete it or change the setting, the next upgrade makes a new admin.
   Its generated password is then in the migrate Job's log
   ([Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).

`make gke-deploy VERSION=v<x.y.z>` (and `gke-deploy-kernel`, `-console`)
deploys a release to GKE: the release's signed charts, which run its signed
images, each signature checked first (cosign, against the release workflow's
identity at exactly that tag; `make gke-verify-release VERSION=...` alone),
with the settings in `helm/values/gke/` and the context named in the
Makefile. It shows what's about to ship and asks you to type the cluster's
name first. The release's packages on ghcr.io must be public (once, in each
package's settings) or `docker login ghcr.io` done first. To try an
unreleased change on a cluster that isn't production,
`gke-deploy-{kernel,console}-from-source` build the working copy with Cloud
Build instead (unsigned, `:latest`). `-policy-controller` and `-eso` install
those charts.

### What the cluster needs

**Room.** What each copy of the platform's parts requests, from the charts'
`values.yaml` (steps come on top: a step without its own size requests the
size preset's `scheduler.taskDefaultResources`):

| Part | CPU | Memory | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| kernel-api | 100m | 256Mi | Always, per copy |
| Scheduler | 100m | 512Mi | Always, per copy |
| Console | 100m | 512Mi | Always, per copy |
| Postgres | 250m | 512Mi | Per instance: one when the kernel's holds the console's database (what `vertra` does), two otherwise |
| Trivy server | 100m | 512Mi, and 4Gi ephemeral storage | While scans run (`scanning.idleMinutes`) |
| Gateway | 50m | 64Mi | `gateway.enabled` |
| Loki, Alloy | 100m, 50m | 256Mi, 128Mi | `logs.enabled` |

So a `minimal` install with one Postgres needs about 650m CPU and 2.3Gi of
memory before any step runs. The migrate Jobs (100m, 256Mi) and the
sleeper's CronJob (50m, 128Mi) run briefly.

**Outbound access.** The platform's NetworkPolicies only limit what may
connect *to* its Pods (the gateway's also limit where it connects), so
nothing in the charts blocks outbound traffic. If your network does, the
platform reaches:

- the registries it pulls and checks images from: ghcr.io for its own
  images (unless you mirror them), the task images' registry, and the
  catalog release's;
- Trivy's vulnerability database (mirror.gcr.io, ghcr.io), when the scanner
  starts and every few hours;
- Sigstore's public services (Fulcio, Rekor) for keyless signatures, from
  the catalog release check and policy-controller;
- the chat agent's provider, when `chat` is set;
- Google (accounts.google.com, and cloudidentity.googleapis.com for group
  mappings) for Google sign-in, and the keyless bots' issuers (`keyless.issuers`) for their keys;
- the SMTP server (`notifications.email`), the teams' chat webhooks
  (`notifications.webhookHosts`) and order callbacks (`orders.callbackHosts`);
- on a cloud, its own APIs for workload identity, buckets (backups, logs,
  the audit copy) and registries.

There's no setting for an HTTP proxy, and no offline mode.

### HTTPS for the console

The console chart reaches the console over HTTPS one of two ways, each with
its certificate issued and renewed for you:

- **An Ingress** (`ingress`: `enabled`, `host`, `className`). The certificate:
  - cert-manager with an issuer you have: `certManager.issuer` (a
    ClusterIssuer, or an Issuer with `issuerKind: Issuer`), e.g. your
    internal CA;
  - Let's Encrypt: `certManager.acme.email`, and the chart makes the Issuer,
    proving the host over HTTP through the same Ingress class (the host must
    resolve to the Ingress from the internet);
  - a Secret you keep: `tlsSecretName`;
  - or the cloud's, through `annotations` (what `vertra` does on GKE and
    EKS).

  `httpsOnly` (on) refuses plain HTTP for the controllers the chart knows:
  Traefik (`websecure` only), NGINX (redirect) and GKE (no HTTP). For
  another, add its own annotation.
- **A Gateway** you run (Gateway API, `gatewayApi`): an HTTPRoute for
  `host` on the Gateway's HTTPS listener (`parentRefs`), and optionally a
  redirect from its HTTP listener (`redirectParentRefs`). The Gateway holds
  the certificate; cert-manager issues it from an annotation on the Gateway
  (`cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer`) with its Gateway API support on.

Either way, the console sends Strict-Transport-Security, so a browser that
has seen it keeps to HTTPS; set `trustProxy` to the load balancer's
addresses so sign-in limits see real clients.

`vertra` does this on an existing cluster: `vertra init` asks whether the
console is reached at a hostname, which Ingress class serves it, and where
its certificate comes from (Let's Encrypt, or a ClusterIssuer of yours), and
offers to install cert-manager (pinned) if the cluster hasn't got it
(`console.public`, `console.hostname`, `console.ingressClass`,
`console.tls.*` in vertra.yaml). `vertra apply` then says which DNS record
the hostname needs (an A record to the Ingress controller's address, or a
CNAME to its name), waits for it to resolve when run interactively, and
reports the certificate's state; `vertra status` shows both. Let's Encrypt
can't issue until the record resolves. On gcp with a hostname of yours,
apply names the A record to the console's reserved address the same way.

On kind, `make kind-tls` installs cert-manager, Traefik (an Ingress
controller and a Gateway at once) and a private test CA
(`helm/values/kind/tls-test.yaml`, which no browser trusts). Then deploy with
the console's `ingress` or `gatewayApi` in a values file under `_local/`
(`make kind-deploy-console KIND_CONSOLE_VALUES=_local/...`), port-forward
Traefik (`kubectl -n traefik port-forward svc/traefik 28443:443`) and check
with `curl --cacert` (the CA is `ca.crt` in `cert-manager/vertra-test-ca`)
and `--resolve <host>:28443:127.0.0.1`.

### Cloud identities

No component needs a stored cloud key. Bind these Kubernetes ServiceAccounts
to cloud identities with the cloud's workload identity (GKE Workload
Identity, EKS Pod Identity or IRSA, AKS Workload Identity), each with only
what it needs:

| ServiceAccount | Needs | Set by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The console's | Read manifests in the registries it checks and pins (`registryCheck`) | `serviceAccount.annotations` |
| The image scanner's | Pull from those registries | `scanning.serviceAccountAnnotations` |
| `vertra-pg-backup` | Write to the backup bucket | You create it ([Backups](#backups)) |
| A team's `eso-<cloud>` | Read that team's secrets in its vault | The team's SecretStore file |
| A product's own | Whatever that product does | The product's `serviceAccount`; an admin adds the binding |

For a registry that needs a password instead, put a
`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` Secret in the platform namespace and name
it in `registryCheck.pullSecretName`; with `registryCheck.copyToTeams`, the
console copies it into every team namespace as `vertra-pull` and the
kernel's `scheduler.taskImagePullSecret` names it on step Pods.

How each binding is made, per cloud (`vertra` makes all of them for an
install of its own; `helm/values/gke/` and `helm/values/eks/` are examples
of the values it writes):

| | GKE (Workload Identity) | EKS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The console, the scanner | Each its own Google service account with `roles/artifactregistry.reader` on the registry, bound to its ServiceAccount (`roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser`), named by its `iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account` annotation; the console's also `roles/aiplatform.user` on the project with the chat agent on Vertex (the scanner, reading images anyone can publish, gets nothing more) | A role that may read the ECR repositories, bound by an EKS Pod Identity association (no annotation); `registryCheck.ecrToken: true` |
| policy-controller (`policy-controller-webhook`) | The same, read-only on the products' registry | The same, by Pod Identity |
| A team's `eso-<cloud>` (its SecretStore) | Its Google service account, by the annotation in the store file | IRSA: the `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn` annotation, a role trusting the cluster's OIDC issuer (registered in IAM once per cluster) for `system:serviceaccount:<team>:eso-aws` only. Pod Identity doesn't work for a store |
| A product's own | Its Google service account, by the annotation an admin adds | A Pod Identity association for `<team>/<serviceAccount>`, which an admin adds |
| Catalog CI (GitHub Actions) | Workload Identity Federation, main only | An IAM OIDC provider for GitHub's issuer, a role trusting the repository's main only |

### Signing in with Google

With `vertra`: `vertra sso google <env>` says which two pages of the Google
Cloud console to open and the exact redirect URI to paste, reads the
client's downloaded JSON (checking it's a web client with that URI), asks
which Workspace domains may sign in, and saves the settings (the file's
path, never its secret). `vertra apply` then writes the secret into a
Kubernetes Secret through stdin and turns it on; `vertra sso off` turns it
off. By hand, with Helm:

1. In the Google Cloud console for a project in your Workspace
   organization, set up the OAuth consent screen (Google Auth Platform) with
   the audience **Internal**, then create an OAuth client of type **Web
   application** whose authorized redirect URI is the console's address +
   `/api/auth/oidc/callback` (`http://localhost:18080/...` for a
   port-forward).
2. Put its secret in a Secret in the console's namespace:
   `kubectl -n vertra-system create secret generic console-sso --from-file=client-secret=<file>`.
3. Set the console chart's `sso`: `issuer: https://accounts.google.com`, the
   `clientId`, `clientSecret.name: console-sso`, the same `redirectUrl`, and
   `allowedDomains` (your Workspace domains). On kind, keep these in a file
   under `_local/` and pass it:
   `make kind-deploy-console KIND_CONSOLE_VALUES=_local/kind-console-sso.yaml`.

People then sign in with Google; the first sign-in makes their account (or
binds the one an admin made for that email), with no teams until someone
adds them. Turning it on changes nothing else: passwords keep working.
Teams then move to Google one at a time: an admin turns on **Require Google
sign-in** on the team's page (`TeamService/SetTeamSignIn`), and its members'
passwords stop working, including sessions they already have (the console
and the gateway both refuse them). Someone in several teams uses Google if
any of them requires it. Admins are exempt, so an admin can still get in if
Google can't be reached; `vertra admin reset-password` remains the way back
for a lost password. A team that can't use Google simply leaves it off.

### The API gateway

API products are served by the gateway, which the console chart runs when
`gateway.enabled` is on. Set `gateway.backendHosts` to the hosts backends
may be under (`orders.example.com`, or `*.a.run.app` for any name below
it); an API under none is held. `gateway.url` is where callers reach it
inside the cluster (its Service, `<release>-execution-console-gateway:8080`);
with `gateway.publicListener`, port 8081 serves the APIs of
`gateway.internetTeams` that ask to be reachable from the internet: put an
Ingress or load balancer in front of it, at `gateway.publicUrl`.
An admin closes it from the Admin page (every API answers 503 with their
message), or `gateway.closed` keeps it closed; a team's maintainers pause
one of theirs from its page. With `gateway.ingress`, an Ingress serves the
public listener at `gateway.ingress.host`. Its NetworkPolicy lets it reach
anything but the cloud metadata server; narrow it with `gateway.egress`.
Backend credentials: `googleIdToken` needs `gateway.gcp` (vertra sets it
on GKE; the API's Google service account grants its ServiceAccount's
principal `roles/iam.serviceAccountOpenIdTokenCreator`), and `awsSigV4` a
role whose trust policy accepts the cluster's OIDC issuer for
`system:serviceaccount:<team>:<api>-api`, audience `sts.amazonaws.com`
(the issuer registered as an IAM OIDC provider; a GKE cluster's is public,
so a GKE install calls AWS backends with no AWS cluster). A Lambda
function URL needs both `lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl` and
`lambda:InvokeFunction` on the role. On kind, `make kind-deploy-console` builds
it and allows backends in the `vertra-samples` namespace.

### Reading another install's catalog

One catalog serves many installs. One install owns its repository (its
`catalog` block: its registry, its `signing`; `vertra catalog create`
refuses a repository that already publishes to another install's registry
unless `--take-over`, which moves it); an install that reads it
sets `externalCatalog.registry` in its vertra.yaml (the image source, and
where its release lives) and the owner's signer in `catalogSignature`:
`publicKeyFile` (a generated key's or the owner's KMS key's public half,
`cosign public-key --key <kms uri>`), and/or `repository` (the catalog
repository, `owner/name`, whose `ci.yml` on main signs keyless). On gcp and
aws the reader then refuses what that signer didn't sign as the owner does,
releases and images: `vertra apply` installs policy-controller, and on the
same cloud prints the grant the registry's owner runs for its identity
(across clouds it reads with the steps' pull Secret). Elsewhere (kind, an
existing cluster) only releases are checked. On the same cloud, also grant
the install's console and scanner identities read on that registry.

For a Google Artifact Registry read from another cloud (EKS, AKS, any
cluster with an OIDC issuer), nothing is stored: the console exchanges its
own ServiceAccount token for an hour's Google token (Workload Identity
Federation) and hands it to the kubelet (`vertra-pull` in each team
namespace) and its Jobs (`vertra-registry-token`), renewed every policy
sync. After the first `vertra apply`, the registry's owner runs, in its
project, the commands apply prints:

```
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create vertra-installs --location=global --project=<project>
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers create-oidc <cluster> --location=global \
  --workload-identity-pool=vertra-installs --project=<project> --issuer-uri=<cluster's OIDC issuer> \
  --attribute-mapping=google.subject=assertion.sub \
  --attribute-condition="assertion.sub=='system:serviceaccount:vertra-system:console-execution-console'"
gcloud artifacts repositories add-iam-policy-binding <repository> --location=<region> --project=<project> \
  --role=roles/artifactregistry.reader \
  --member=principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/<number>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/vertra-installs/subject/system:serviceaccount:vertra-system:console-execution-console
```

then sets `externalCatalog.gcpWorkloadIdentityProvider` to
`projects/<number>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/vertra-installs/providers/<cluster>`
and applies again. The provider trusts only that cluster's issuer, and only
the console's ServiceAccount from it. Revoke the install by deleting its
provider.

### Catalog versions

An install applies every release its catalog's `main` publishes (`latest`)
unless it follows versions: `vertra config set -e <env> catalogVersion
newest` (the newest `vX.Y.Z`; the console chart's `catalog.newestVersion`)
or `catalogVersion v1.4.0` (pinned: `catalog.release` ends `:v1.4.0`), then
`vertra apply`. A version is made by a `vX.Y.Z` Git tag in the catalog
repository, which tags the release `main` already published for that commit
(`vertra catalog promote`, catalog-template's `version.yml`): the same
digests and signature, so a production install following `newest` gets
what a test install on `latest` already ran, when someone cuts the tag. To
roll back, pin the previous version; versions never move. The Admin page's
Catalog card shows the version applied.

### Sizes, sleeping and headroom

Each chart ships four presets in `sizes/` (`minimal`, `resilient`,
`scaled`, `auto`), layered under your values with `-f`. They set the
copies of the console, kernel-api and the scheduler (with
PodDisruptionBudgets from two copies, so drains and upgrades take one at a
time), the scheduler's step caps and default step size (and, in `scaled`,
its `claimLimit` and `executorConcurrency`), how long executions are kept
and the database volume's size; `auto` scales the console and kernel-api from one to three
copies on CPU load, and needs the cluster's metrics API (metrics-server;
built into GKE, EKS Auto Mode and AKS Automatic). `vertra` picks one
from its `size` setting. A preset doesn't say where steps run: Spot is
`scheduler.taskPlacement`. Labels every step Pod needs, such as AKS
Workload Identity's `azure.workload.identity/use: "true"`, go in
`scheduler.taskPodLabels`.

| Preset | Console | kernel-api | Scheduler | Steps at once (all, per team) | Executions kept | Kernel database volume |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None (the charts' defaults) | 1 | 1 | 1 | no cap | 90 days | 1Gi |
| `minimal` | 1 | 1 | 1 | 10, 5 | 30 days | 10Gi |
| `resilient` | 2 | 2 | 1 | 50, 20 | 90 days | 50Gi |
| `scaled` | 3 | 3 | 2 | 200, 50 | 90 days | 100Gi |
| `auto` | 1 to 3 | 1 to 3 | 1 | 50, 20 | 90 days | 50Gi |

**More than one copy.** kernel-api holds no state, so any number of
copies is safe. So is more than one scheduler: each claims steps with
`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` under a lease, so two never claim the same step,
and one that dies has its running steps adopted by another when its leases
expire. The one thing that loosens is the step caps: `maxRunningTasks` and
`maxRunningTasksPerTeam` are exact with one scheduler, and with several
each counts on its own and can overshoot by up to one `claimLimit`. A
product's own cap and concurrency key stay exact. Several console copies
share everything through the database (the catalog sync and the audit copy
run on one at a time), except the sign-in throttle, which each copy keeps
in its own memory.

- **Sleeping when idle** (kernel chart, `scaleDown`): a CronJob scales both
  releases' Deployments to zero after `idleAfterMinutes` with no execution
  unfinished or recently finished, nobody using the console (the console
  records its last use in its `activity` ConfigMap) and kernel-api not
  restarted; `schedule` also sleeps it at set times once nothing runs.
  Volumes stay. Wake it with `vertra wake`, or by scaling each
  Deployment back to the copies recorded in the
  `kernel-execution-kernel-sleep` ConfigMap (the database first). While
  asleep, the console and kernel-api don't answer, so catalog CI fails
  until it's woken. A `helm upgrade` while asleep wakes it (pass
  `--force-conflicts`: the sleeper owns the replica counts it set).
- **The image scanner idles** on its own (console chart,
  `scanning.idleMinutes`, 15 by default): scaled to zero when no scan has
  been asked for in that long, and back up for the next, whose first scan
  then waits about a minute for it.
- **Warm headroom** (kernel chart, `stepHeadroom.replicas`): placeholder
  Pods the size of a default step, at a priority every step outranks, so
  a step takes a placeholder's place instead of waiting for a node. It's
  reserved around the clock: for always-on installs.

### Metrics and alerts

Everyone signed in sees the Observe page's Metrics tab, which needs nothing
installed: steps started and how long they waited, why they failed, and
each product's step times, from kernel-api's own tables.

For Prometheus, every component serves `/metrics`: kernel-api on its API
port (8000), the scheduler on `scheduler.metricsPort`, and the console
(`monitoring.port`) and gateway on 9090. The console's metrics port is
never behind its Ingress. Each is open only to
`networkPolicy.metricsFrom`, so list your Prometheus there, in both charts:

```yaml
networkPolicy:
  metricsFrom:
    - namespaceSelector: {matchLabels: {kubernetes.io/metadata.name: monitoring}}
```

On kind or an existing cluster, `vertra init` finds a Prometheus Operator
and offers all of this (`--monitoring`), reading which labels its Prometheus
selects PodMonitors and rules by and which namespace it scrapes from, so
nothing needs looking up.

With the Prometheus Operator (kube-prometheus-stack; VictoriaMetrics's
operator reads the same resources), the charts can add the rest, each off
by default because it needs that operator's CRDs. GKE's Managed Service
for Prometheus doesn't read them: it has its own `PodMonitoring`, which
the charts don't ship yet (`TODO.md`).

- `monitoring.podMonitor.enabled` (both charts): PodMonitors. Add the
  labels your Prometheus selects them by in `monitoring.podMonitor.labels`
  (kube-prometheus-stack: `release: <its release name>`).
- `monitoring.alerts.enabled` (both charts): PrometheusRules.
  `VertraSchedulerDown` (no pass in 10 minutes while the scheduler should
  be running; needs kube-state-metrics, so an install that's asleep isn't
  down), `VertraSchedulerFailing`, `VertraStepsWaiting` (the oldest ready
  step waited past `monitoring.alerts.readyWaitSeconds`),
  `VertraConsoleFailing`, `VertraSignInBurst`, `VertraCatalogNotApplying`
  and `VertraGatewayBackendUnreachable`.
- `monitoring.dashboard.enabled` (console chart): the Grafana dashboard
  (`files/grafana-dashboard.json`: steps, the console, the gateway) as a
  ConfigMap labelled for Grafana's dashboard sidecar; set
  `monitoring.dashboard.namespace` if the sidecar watches only Grafana's.

The metrics, for alerts and dashboards of your own:

| Metric | Labels | What it counts |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `kernel_oldest_ready_task_age_seconds` | | How long the longest-waiting `READY` step has waited; 0 when none is |
| `kernel_scheduler_tick_duration_seconds` | | One scheduler pass |

| `vertra_gateway_requests_total` | `api`, `outcome` | Gateway requests, by what happened to them |

**Health.** kernel-api and the console answer `GET /health/live` (the
process is up) and `GET /health/ready` on their API ports: kernel-api's is
ready once its database answers and is at the schema its code expects, the
console's once its database answers. The charts' probes use them. The
scheduler serves no health endpoint: its loop touches a heartbeat file each
time round, and its liveness probe restarts it when the file is older than
`scheduler.livenessSeconds` (120).

**Log format.** One JSON object per line on stdout. The kernel's carry
`timestamp`, `severity` (`INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`), `logger`, `message`
and `service` (`kernel-api`, `kernel-scheduler`, `kernel-migrate`,
`kernel-sleeper`), then the line's own
fields; kernel-api logs each request with its `requestId` (`X-Request-ID`,
reused or generated). The console's are Fastify's (pino's: a numeric
`level`, `time`, `msg`, `reqId`), and its own events carry an `event`
field, such as `catalog_sync_failed`. The level is fixed at INFO; there's
no setting for it.

### The audit log's copy

The console hash-chains its audit log: each entry's hash covers the entry
before it, so changing, removing or adding one breaks every later hash. With
the console chart's `audit.export` (vertra: `audit.export` in vertra.yaml, on
gcp and aws), every `minutes` it checks the new entries' chain and copies
them as one JSON-lines object (`<prefix><yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/<first>-<last>.jsonl`)
to a bucket that refuses deletes and overwrites, create-only on its side
too. A broken chain stops the copy where it breaks; Observe's security
checks say where, and `ObserveService/GetAuditCopy` gives the copy's state
(how far it has gone, what's waiting, the entry where the chain broke; the
bucket to admins).

- **gcs**: a retention policy of `audit.keepDays`; the console's Google
  identity may only create objects.
- **s3**: Object Lock, governance mode, `audit.keepDays`; the console's role
  may only put objects.
- `audit.lock: true` locks it: GCS locked retention, S3 compliance mode.
  Nobody, the cloud account's owners included, can then shorten it, and the
  bucket can't be deleted until the last object's retention lapses. That's
  the point, and it's permanent: decide before you set it.

`vertra destroy` never deletes the audit bucket. On kind, `make
kind-audit-store` runs SeaweedFS (S3 with Object Lock) with a bucket locked
for a day; point `audit.export` at it in a values file under `_local/`.

### Logs

Observe's Logs tab searches every step's output (and, for admins, the
platform's own) when the console chart's `logs.enabled` is on (`vertra`:
`logs.enabled` in vertra.yaml). Grafana Alloy collects through the
Kubernetes API, redacting credentials, into one Loki; the console queries
Loki with each caller's visibility added. Each step's Job is kept
`scheduler.releaseFinishedAfterSeconds` (kernel chart, 30) after it
finishes so the collector reads it all.

- `logs.searchDays` (30): how far back anyone searches.
- `logs.keepDays` (365): when Loki deletes them.
- `logs.storage`: `filesystem` (kind's: every log on Loki's volume),
  `gcs` or `s3` with a `bucket`. Loki always has a volume of `size` for
  its write-ahead log and the index it uploads every 15 minutes, so a
  restart loses nothing (`vertra` gives it 2Gi with a bucket). Loki's identity goes on its ServiceAccount
  (`serviceAccountName`, `serviceAccountAnnotations`).

Archiving is the bucket's: on gcp and aws, `vertra` creates
`<project>-<name>-logs` (GCS) or `<name>-logs-<account>-<region>` (S3)
with a lifecycle rule moving Loki's chunks (`fake/`) to the Archive class
(GCS) or Glacier Instant Retrieval (S3) after `searchDays`, and deleting
everything a day after `keepDays`. Loki still reads archived chunks, so an
admin can query older logs with Loki's own tools (`logcli`) through a
port-forward; the console searches only `searchDays` back. S3 moves only
objects of 128 KB or more by default, so a quiet install's smallest chunks
stay in Standard (at a negligible cost). Archived
storage costs a fraction of a cent per GB-month, but has a minimum stay
(GCS Archive 365 days, Glacier IR 90), billed if deleted earlier. A volume
has no archive class: logs are kept on it until `keepDays`.
`vertra destroy` keeps the logs bucket unless you delete the data too.

### Uninstalling

`vertra destroy` does this for you (setup.md says what it keeps). By hand,
the console first, then the kernel:

```
helm uninstall console -n vertra-system --wait
helm uninstall kernel -n vertra-system --wait
```

That removes the platform's Pods, Services, RBAC and admission policies.
It leaves:

- **The databases' volumes.** `postgres.persistence.keepOnUninstall` (on by
  default) keeps each PVC. Delete them when you mean to:
  `kubectl -n vertra-system delete pvc -l 'app.kubernetes.io/instance in (kernel,console)'`.
- **The team namespaces**, with their Secrets, ServiceAccounts and anything
  steps made there. The console created them, not Helm. Delete them with
  `kubectl delete namespace -l vertra/team` (retired ones included).
- Anything outside the charts: buckets, cloud identities, the registry, and
  the platform namespace itself.

## Upgrading

`helm upgrade` with the same values files and `--reset-values`. Two things
to know:

- **Upgrade the kernel chart with `--force-conflicts`.** The console edits
  the kernel's image, identity and scan policies, so Helm's server-side
  apply sees it as their owner; without the flag the upgrade fails with a
  conflict. The chart writes back what the console last set, so nothing is
  lost.
- **Migrations run first**, as a Helm hook, before any new Pod starts, on
  every upgrade (a no-op when nothing's pending). The scheduler waits for
  them on a fresh install.

**Images reused under the same tag.** With `pullPolicy: IfNotPresent` (the
default) and a reused tag such as `:latest`, a node that already has the old
image keeps it. Deploy by digest (`image.digest`) or a new tag, or set
`pullPolicy: Always` and `kubectl rollout restart` the Deployments (a Helm
upgrade that changes nothing in the Pod template doesn't restart them).
Check what's really running with
`kubectl get pods -o jsonpath='{..imageID}'`.

### Choosing the version

With `vertra`, the release an install runs is the `vertra` key in
vertra.yaml (`source` builds the working copy instead):
`vertra config set -e <env> vertra <x.y.z>`, then `vertra apply <env>`.
With Helm, it's the charts' `--version`; each chart defaults to the images
released with it. Upgrade the kernel first, as on install.

### Rolling back

Migrations only go forward, so a rollback across one means restoring the
databases:

- The kernel runs only against the schema its code expects. kernel-api
  isn't ready until the database is at exactly its newest migration, and
  the scheduler waits for it, logging "waiting for database migrations"
  with the version it expects and the one it found. Older code against a
  newer schema waits forever: `helm rollback` of the kernel works only if
  the upgrade applied no migration (the release added no file to
  `kernel/internal/migrate/sql/`).
- The console doesn't check its schema. Older console code against a newer
  schema isn't tested; don't rely on it.

So take a backup before an upgrade, by running the backup CronJob by hand
(and the console's, `console-execution-console-pg-backup`, when it has its
own Postgres):
`kubectl -n vertra-system create job --from=cronjob/kernel-execution-kernel-pg-backup pre-upgrade`.
To go back: install the previous release's charts, then restore that backup
([Restoring](#backups)).

## Databases

Each chart can run its own Postgres (`postgres.enabled`), a single replica
on a volume; or use an external database. On a small install the kernel's
Postgres can also hold the console's database (`postgres.consoleDatabase`),
where the console signs in as its own role, which owns only its database.

**Passwords** are generated on install when left empty, kept in the
release's Secret (`<release>-execution-kernel-db` for the kernel,
`<release>-execution-console` for the console) and read back on every
upgrade. To rotate one:

```
NS=vertra-system; PG=deploy/kernel-execution-kernel-postgres; SECRET=kernel-execution-kernel-db
NEW=$(openssl rand -hex 24)
# 1. The role, sent on stdin so it never shows in a process list.
printf "ALTER ROLE postgres PASSWORD '%s';\n" "$NEW" | kubectl -n $NS exec -i $PG -- psql -q -U postgres -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1
# 2. Both fields of the Secret, before any helm upgrade (the migration hook reads database-url).
URL=$(kubectl -n $NS get secret $SECRET -o jsonpath='{.data.database-url}' | base64 -d | sed "s|^\([^:]*://[^:]*\):[^@]*@|\1:$NEW@|")
kubectl -n $NS patch secret $SECRET --type merge -p "{\"stringData\":{\"postgres-password\":\"$NEW\",\"database-url\":\"$URL\"}}"
# 3. Restart what holds the old one.
kubectl -n $NS rollout restart deployment kernel-execution-kernel-api kernel-execution-kernel-scheduler
```

A console with its own Postgres is the same with its Secret
(`console-execution-console`, deployment `console-execution-console-postgres`),
then restart the console, and the gateway if it runs.

When the kernel's Postgres holds the console's database (what `vertra`
installs), the console signs in as the role `console`, whose password is in
`kernel-execution-kernel-console-db` (keys `password` and `database-url`).
Every kernel install and upgrade sets the role's password from that Secret
(the `console-db` hook Job), so change both together:

```
NS=vertra-system; PG=deploy/kernel-execution-kernel-postgres; SECRET=kernel-execution-kernel-console-db
NEW=$(openssl rand -hex 24)
printf "ALTER ROLE console PASSWORD '%s';\n" "$NEW" | kubectl -n $NS exec -i $PG -- psql -q -U postgres -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1
URL=$(kubectl -n $NS get secret $SECRET -o jsonpath='{.data.database-url}' | base64 -d | sed "s|^\([^:]*://[^:]*\):[^@]*@|\1:$NEW@|")
kubectl -n $NS patch secret $SECRET --type merge -p "{\"stringData\":{\"password\":\"$NEW\",\"database-url\":\"$URL\"}}"
kubectl -n $NS rollout restart deployment console-execution-console   # and console-execution-console-gateway, if it runs
```

Checking a password from inside the Postgres Pod proves nothing: local
connections are trusted there. The console's other secret, the one that
signs sessions, is under [Rotating secrets](#rotating-secrets).

**Connecting.** Neither database is exposed outside the cluster, and
NetworkPolicies admit only the platform's own Pods. To look at one:

```
kubectl -n vertra-system exec -it deploy/kernel-execution-kernel-postgres -- psql -U postgres -d execution_kernel
# or execution_console (in the console's Postgres, or the kernel's when it holds both)
```

Always pass `--context`: port-forward output doesn't say which cluster it
reached. Writing by hand bypasses every check the console makes; use the
API for anything it can do. What's in each database:
[architecture.md](architecture.md#data).

**Retention.** Finished executions (with their tasks, outputs, logs and
events) are deleted 90 days after their last event
(`executionRetentionDays`; the console's record of them, its audit log and
scan verdicts have their own settings in `retention`). 0 keeps them forever.
The scheduler deletes them once an hour, so nothing is deleted while it's
stopped or the install is asleep.

**Sizing.** What grows is the kernel's database, by step: each step keeps
its outputs (at most 4 KB), its events, and the last
`scheduler.taskLogs.maxLines` lines of its log, at most
`scheduler.taskLogs.maxBytes` (1 MiB). So a chatty step can cost up to a
megabyte, kept for `executionRetentionDays`. The size presets give the
kernel's volume 10, 50 or 100Gi; without one it's the charts' 1Gi, which a
busy install outgrows. The volume's size is a plain PVC request: raising
it on an upgrade works only if its storage class allows volume expansion,
and Kubernetes refuses to shrink one, which fails the upgrade (so going
from `scaled` to `resilient` needs `postgres.persistence.size` kept at
the larger size). Postgres doesn't hand space from deleted rows back to the
disk; it reuses it.

## Rotating secrets

The databases' passwords: [Databases](#databases). The registry pull
Secret (`registryCheck.pullSecretName`): replace it, and the next policy
sync copies it to every team.

**The console's `JWT_SECRET`** signs every session (through an Ed25519 key
derived from it, whose public half the gateway reads from the console). It also seals the values the
console keeps in its database to use itself: teams' chat webhook URLs,
order callbacks and their signing secrets, the Google sign-in client secret
set on the Admin page, and the chat agent's key set there. It's generated on
install, kept in the `jwt-secret` key of the `console-execution-console`
Secret and read back on every upgrade; the chart's `jwtSecret` overrides
it. To rotate it:

```
kubectl -n vertra-system patch secret console-execution-console --type json -p '[{"op":"remove","path":"/data/jwt-secret"}]'
helm upgrade console ...   # your usual upgrade: a new one is generated
kubectl -n vertra-system rollout restart deployment console-execution-console
```

A changed Secret restarts nothing by itself, hence the restart. The
gateway needs none: it reads the new public key the first time a session
names it. Then:

- every session ends, so everyone signs in again;
- every sealed value becomes unreadable and has to be entered again: each
  team's webhooks and callbacks, the Admin page's sign-in and chat
  settings (chat turns itself off and says why until then).

## Backups

Off by default, for the bundled Postgres only. With the installer, turn them
on with `vertra config set -e <env> database.backups.enabled true`, then
`vertra apply <env>`; with Helm alone, the charts' `backup.enabled`. A CronJob
in each chart runs `pg_dump -Fc`, checks the dump with `pg_restore --list`,
names it `<release>/<UTC timestamp>.pgdump` (with the console's database, on
a shared instance, as `<backupPrefix>/<same timestamp>.pgdump`), and copies it
to `backup.destination`:

| `destination` | Copies with | Signs in with | Proven |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gcs` | `gsutil cp` | GKE Workload Identity | On GKE Autopilot (2026-10-26): dumped, downloaded, restored |
| `s3` | `aws s3 cp` | EKS Pod Identity or IRSA; a key in `s3.credentialsSecret` for an S3-compatible service without one | On EKS Auto Mode with Pod Identity (2026-10-26), and on kind against an S3-compatible service |
| `azure` | `az storage blob upload --auth-mode login` | AKS Workload Identity | Not yet |
| `pvc` | `cp`, deleting dumps older than `pvc.keepDays` | Nothing | On kind |

For the cloud destinations, the copy runs as `backup.serviceAccountName`
(default `vertra-pg-backup`). Create it in the platform namespace and bind
it to an identity that may write to the bucket and nothing else: on GCS,
`roles/storage.objectCreator` and `roles/storage.objectViewer` on the bucket
(`gsutil` lists before writing); on S3, `s3:PutObject`; on Azure, Storage Blob
Data Contributor on the container. Keep dumps as long as you need with a
lifecycle rule on the bucket. For `pvc`, create the claim yourself
(`backup.pvc.claimName`): most storage classes bind a volume only once a Pod
uses it, which would hang `helm upgrade --wait`.

**Restoring** (proven on kind, replacing both live databases on a shared
instance; with two instances, restore each on its own):

```
# 1. Download a matching pair (gcloud storage cp, aws s3 cp, az storage blob download).
# 2. Note each Deployment's copies, then stop everything that writes
#    (the scheduler releases its leases on the way out).
kubectl -n $NS get deployment kernel-execution-kernel-api kernel-execution-kernel-scheduler console-execution-console
kubectl -n $NS scale deployment kernel-execution-kernel-api kernel-execution-kernel-scheduler console-execution-console --replicas=0
# 3. Copy the dumps into the Postgres Pod.
kubectl -n $NS exec -i deploy/kernel-execution-kernel-postgres -- sh -c 'cat > /tmp/kernel.pgdump' < kernel.pgdump
kubectl -n $NS exec -i deploy/kernel-execution-kernel-postgres -- sh -c 'cat > /tmp/console.pgdump' < console.pgdump
# 4. Inside the Pod (kubectl exec -it ... -- sh):
export PGUSER=postgres
dropdb --force execution_kernel && createdb execution_kernel
pg_restore --exit-on-error -d execution_kernel /tmp/kernel.pgdump
dropdb --force execution_console && createdb -O console execution_console
pg_restore --exit-on-error --no-owner --role=console -d execution_console /tmp/console.pgdump
psql -c 'REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE execution_kernel FROM PUBLIC' \
     -c 'REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE execution_console FROM PUBLIC' \
     -c 'GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE execution_console TO console'
rm /tmp/*.pgdump
# 5. Start everything again, each at the copies noted in step 2.
kubectl -n $NS scale deployment kernel-execution-kernel-api --replicas=<as before>
kubectl -n $NS scale deployment kernel-execution-kernel-scheduler --replicas=<as before>
kubectl -n $NS scale deployment console-execution-console --replicas=<as before>
```

The console's database must stay owned by its own role, or the console
can't use its tables. To only check a backup, restore it into a new
database instead.

**Onto a new cluster.** The databases hold the platform's records, not
everything the cluster held. After installing the same release on the new
cluster and restoring both databases as above:

- **Team namespaces aren't re-created on their own.** The console's
  policy sync, at startup and every `policySyncIntervalSeconds` (300),
  rewrites the admission policies' lists, and each team's network policy,
  quota and pull Secret, but only into namespaces that already exist; for a
  missing one it reports a failure (Admin page, `AdminService/GetPolicySync`).
  A catalog team's namespace comes back when a catalog release is applied:
  press **Sync now** on the Admin page's Catalog card, which applies the
  current release again even though it hasn't changed. Any other team's
  namespace has to be created by hand, labelled `vertra/team=true` (and
  `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=restricted`, as the console would).
- **Team secrets' values are gone.** The console records each secret's name
  and keys, never its value, and the values lived only in the old cluster's
  Secrets. Secrets synced from a vault come back once the team's SecretStore
  is applied again (a catalog release does it); the rest have to be set
  again.
- **Products' ServiceAccounts** are made again when products are
  registered, without the cloud-identity annotations an admin added: add
  those again, and the cloud side's bindings for the new cluster.
- **Unfinished steps** whose Jobs were on the old cluster fail as
  `JOB_NOT_FOUND` (retryable: retried if their `maxAttempts` allows).

This is drawn from the code, not yet rehearsed end to end.

## Network policies

Both charts ship NetworkPolicies (`networkPolicy.enabled`, on by default):

| Pod | Accepts connections from |
| --- | --- |
| Kernel Postgres | The kernel release's Pods, and the console's when it holds the console's database |
| kernel-api | The console (`networkPolicy.consoleSelector`), and `networkPolicy.metricsFrom` |
| Scheduler | `networkPolicy.metricsFrom` only |
| Console | Anyone on its port; its metrics port, `networkPolicy.metricsFrom` only |
| Gateway | Anyone on its ports; its metrics port, `networkPolicy.metricsFrom` only |
| Console Postgres | The console release's Pods |

So a step can reach neither database nor kernel-api.

Each team namespace gets one too, `vertra-default-deny`, written by the
console with the namespace and rewritten on every policy resync (console
chart, `teamNamespaces.defaultDenyIngress`, on by default; only when the
console manages team namespaces). Its Pods accept connections only from
Pods in the same namespace, so teams can't reach each other. With the
gateway on, a second one, `vertra-gateway-ingress`, lets the gateway's Pods
(and nothing else) reach the Pods a team labels `vertra/api-backend: "true"`:
an API product whose backend runs in the team's own namespace
(`samples/local/apis/greetings`; on kind, `make kind-sample-api`). A
namespace the console doesn't manage needs the same policies from whoever
made it. Outbound traffic isn't restricted, except, with
`teamNamespaces.blockMetadata` (on EKS), a third policy,
`vertra-no-metadata`, which lets a team's Pods out anywhere but the
instance metadata server (`169.254.169.254`, `fd00:ec2::254`), so a step
can't take its node's role. Never turn it on for GKE: Workload Identity is
served at that address.

## The chat agent

The console's **Ask** panel (decision 24) answers from the docs, citing
them, looks at what a person's teams have, and fills a cart for them to
place. It's off until the console chart's `chat.model` is set, with
`chat.provider` one of three: `vertex`, Gemini through Vertex AI in
`chat.vertex.project` (on with no `chat.model`: Gemini 3.5 Flash,
`google/gemini-3.5-flash`, the one scored; name another only after
scoring it;
`chat.vertex.location` global, or a region to keep requests in it),
signed in as the console's Workload Identity with no key, its Google
service account needing `roles/aiplatform.user` there: what `vertra`
sets up on GCP (`chat.off` in vertra.yaml turns it off, `chat.model`
picks another); `openai-compatible`, with `chat.endpoint` the
model's base URL (`.../v1`): LM Studio or Ollama on a laptop (kind's values
point at `host.docker.internal:1234`), any other server of
`/chat/completions`; or `anthropic`, Claude
through Anthropic's API (`chat.model` such as `claude-haiku-5-5`). A key,
when one's needed, is a Secret named in `chat.apiKeySecret` (key
`api-key`): `kubectl -n vertra-system create secret generic console-chat-key
--from-file=api-key=<file>`. What a person asks, and what
the agent's tools find for them, goes to the model: on a cloud, use one in
the install's own. `chat.maxSteps` (8), `timeoutSeconds` (180) and
`maxTokens` (8000 on anthropic and vertex, where thinking counts toward
it; else 1500) bound one answer; `chat.effort` sets how hard Claude or
Gemini thinks. `chat.contextTokens` (64000 on anthropic and vertex, else 16000; at most the model's
own window) bounds what one model call is sent, and so its cost (Claude
Haiku 5.5 costs five times as much for a prompt over 100K tokens: keep it
under): a
conversation that won't fit is refused (`CONVERSATION_TOO_LONG`; the panel
offers a new one, and says when one passes 75%), and a tool result that
won't fit is held back from the model.

Admins can set the model in the console instead (Admin, Chat agent): the
provider, model, key and limits, tried with one question before saving,
in place of the install's until they go back to it. The key is kept
sealed (from `JWT_SECRET`), never shown again; for the install's own
provider, left out, the install's is used. An admin's settings that stop
working (a key that no longer unseals after `JWT_SECRET` changes) turn chat
off and say why there, rather than falling back.

It answers only about Vertra. A short check of each question, by the same
model with no tools, answers anything else with one fixed sentence
(`offTopic`), and the prompt holds the same scope; an answer from neither
the docs it cites nor the platform's tools is never shown, the console's
"I couldn't find that" in its place. Score a model
before trusting it: `npm run chat-eval` in `console/` asks it the question
set (`console/test/docQuestions.ts`), the ordering tasks and questions
it must refuse (`console/test/chatTasks.ts`). The console logs each answer's steps
(`chat_answered`: tools used, sources, citations, and `tokens`: input,
cache reads and writes, output, as the provider counted them), not what was
said. With Haiku 5.5 (2026-10-28, kind): a docs question about 9,000 input
tokens over three calls, under a tenth of a cent; an order about 27,000
over six, 78% read from the cache, about $0.0015; an off-topic question
one call of about 500. With Gemini 3.5 Flash on Vertex: the same scores,
a median of 6.4 s, a question about 7,900 input tokens and an order
about 25,000, little of it cached (Vertex caches only implicitly here).
People rate answers up or down in the panel; Admin's Chat agent section lists them
(question, answer, sources, what was wrong), kept 90 days. A wrong answer
is usually a doc to fix, or a question to add to the question set.

## Throughput

When steps start late, or the scheduler seems slow with steps waiting their
turn, look here first. How many steps a second an install starts and finishes is, in practice,
set by its Kubernetes API calls, not its database: the scheduler and
Postgres alone manage hundreds a second, while each step costs the kernel
about five to seven API calls. The kernel chart's `kubernetesClient` (`qps`,
`burst`) is the kernel's own limit on those calls; at client-go's default
of 5 a second the scheduler finishes about one step a second, whatever else
is set, and logs "client-side throttling". The chart sets 50 and 100, which
tripled kind's throughput (`perf/README.md`); the API server's own priority
and fairness stays in charge of a busy install. Raise it further only if the
scheduler's log still shows throttling. `scheduler.maxRunningTasks` and
`maxRunningTasksPerTeam` cap how many steps run at once (0: no cap), so a
burst of runs queues instead of starting every Pod at once. A second
scheduler (`scheduler.replicaCount`, 2 in `scaled`) is safe, but loosens
those caps ([More than one copy](#sizes-sleeping-and-headroom)).

## Troubleshooting

**The first admin's password is lost.** It's printed once, by the first
migrate Job, and the next upgrade replaces that log. `vertra admin
reset-password <env>` gives that admin (or `--email` another) a new random
password, shown once, from inside the console's Pod: only someone with
access to the cluster can. Every session the account had is signed out,
and the reset is in the audit log. The admin then has to choose their own
password before doing anything else, as anyone given a password by someone
else does (a new account's, or an admin's reset of theirs). Without vertra: `kubectl exec
deploy/console-execution-console -n vertra-system -- node
dist/db/resetAdmin.js <email>`.

**An admin account appeared after an upgrade.** Every console install and
upgrade creates an admin with the console chart's `bootstrapAdmin.email`
(`admin.email` in vertra.yaml) when no account has that email: the first
admin's account was deleted, or the setting changed. Its password is in the
migrate Job's log (`kubectl -n vertra-system logs
job/console-execution-console-migrate`), kept until the next upgrade, and
must be changed at its first sign-in. Delete the account on the Admin page
only after setting `bootstrapAdmin.email` to an admin who stays, or it comes
back with the next upgrade.

**`401` from the console's API.** The token is missing, malformed, expired
(sessions last 8 hours), from before a password change (which signs out
every session), signed out, or a revoked or expired bot token. Everyone at once: the console's
`JWT_SECRET` changed ([Rotating secrets](#rotating-secrets)).

**`429` signing in.** Too many attempts from one address for one account:
wait for the time shown. The counts are in the console's database, shared
by every copy, so restarting the console doesn't clear them; to let someone
in sooner, delete their row from `sign_in_failures` (and
`rate_limit_windows` rows whose key ends in their email).

**A submission is refused.** The response says why:
- `403`: not a member of a team the DAG names; a secret not registered for
  its team; or an image that isn't one of the team's products asking for
  secrets or an identity.
- `422`: the DAG itself (every problem listed), an input that looks like a
  credential, or `IMAGE_NOT_RESOLVED` (the registry doesn't have the tag,
  or the console can't reach it: check `registryCheck` and, on kind,
  `make kind-registry`).
- `409 IMAGE_SCAN_PENDING`: its first scan is still running; submit again
  in a minute. `IMAGE_SCAN_FAILED`: it has a fixable HIGH/CRITICAL
  vulnerability or a secret in it; rebuild it, or an admin accepts it with a
  reason (Admin page, or `ImageService/AcceptImageScan`).

**A task fails with a policy code** (non-retryable, refused by the cluster):

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `DISPATCH_REJECTED` | Its namespace isn't labelled `vertra/team=true` |
| `IMAGE_NOT_ALLOWED` | Its image isn't under an allowed source (Admin page) |
| `IMAGE_NOT_PINNED`, `IMAGE_SCAN_FAILED` | Not pinned by digest; a failed scan |
| `IMAGE_NOT_SIGNED` | Not signed by the catalog's key (with policy-controller) |
| `INPUT_INVALID`, `OUTPUT_INVALID` | Not refused by the cluster but by the kernel: its resolved inputs, or its outputs, don't fit its product's schema (`product.yaml`'s `input` and `output`) |
| `IDENTITY_NOT_ALLOWED` | A ServiceAccount or secret its product isn't allowed. If the console allowed it, the policy may be behind: the Admin's policy sync (`AdminService/GetPolicySync`) shows the last sync's outcome |

**A task never starts, or stays `RUNNING`.** `kubectl get pods -n <team>`
and `kubectl describe pod` name the real problem. A first pull on a cloud
cluster can take a minute while a node scales up. `IMAGE_NOT_FOUND` fails
at once; other pull errors (registry auth, network) fail as
`IMAGE_PULL_FAILED` after two minutes. A step over its team's resource
limits (`teamNamespaces.quota`, or the team's own on its Settings tab)
waits while the team's other steps use the quota (`kubectl get events -n
<team>` says "exceeded quota"), and fails at once as `RESOURCES_NOT_ALLOWED`
when it could never fit.

**A task stays `AWAITING_APPROVAL`.** Its product (or its team's
`allowedTargets`) asks a maintainer of its team to approve it, on the run's
page; the person who ran it can't. Nobody deciding within the kernel
chart's `scheduler.approvalTimeoutSeconds` (3 days; 0 never) fails it with
`APPROVAL_EXPIRED`.

**A task fails with `OUTPUT_CONTAINS_CREDENTIAL`.** Its outputs held
something shaped like a credential, so they weren't stored: the product must
output a reference instead.

**A synced secret doesn't arrive.** `kubectl describe externalsecret <name>
-n <team>` names the failure. Check the store too: `kubectl get secretstore
-n <team>` showing `Ready: False` means the store's own sign-in is broken
(its workload identity binding, or an expired bootstrap credential).

**Old code still runs after a redeploy.** See [Upgrading](#upgrading):
reused tags.

**A catalog workflow shows "a workflow file issue" and runs no jobs.** It
didn't parse. Run `actionlint` on it; a common cause is using `secrets` in a
step's `if:` (move it to `env:` and test that).

**The catalog release doesn't apply.** The Admin page's Catalog card shows
the last check's error and what was applied, and `VertraCatalogNotApplying`
fires after an hour of failures. A failed check applies nothing: the last
release applied stays in force. The console logs each failure as
`catalog_sync_failed`. The usual causes:
- "no trusted signer signed the catalog release": `catalog.signature`
  doesn't match who signed it (another key, or a keyless identity whose
  subject doesn't match `subjectRegExp`). The console's log has cosign's own
  output (`catalog_release_unverified`). The verify Job reaches the
  registry by the name in `catalog.release`, with `registryCheck`'s
  credentials or the scan Jobs' cloud identity; on kind it can't reach
  `localhost:5001`.
- "has no version yet": the install follows `newest` (or a pinned
  version) and the catalog has no `vX.Y.Z` tag for it yet.
- The registry can't be read: check `registryCheck` and the console's
  identity on the registry.

A release that applied with problems (some teams, products or SecretStores
refused, each logged as `catalog_apply_problem`) applied everything else;
the card lists what was refused. A team the catalog didn't make is one of
them until an admin adopts it. **Sync now** checks again at once and applies
the current release even if it hasn't changed.

**On kind:**
- Docker Desktop restarted and the node stopped (`docker ps -a` shows
  `vertra-local-control-plane` as `Exited`): `make up`. If `docker start`
  itself fails, restart Docker Desktop.
- The console stopped answering after a redeploy: its port-forward was on
  the old Pod; `make up`.
- `postgres:16` won't load with a TLS error on some networks: `docker save`
  it, `docker cp` it onto the node, and import it with
  `ctr --namespace=k8s.io images import` there.
- Forgotten local admin password:

  ```
  HASH=$(kubectl -n vertra-system exec deploy/console-execution-console -- \
    node -e "require('./dist/auth/password.js').hashPassword('vertra-local').then(console.log)")
  kubectl -n vertra-system exec deploy/kernel-execution-kernel-postgres -- \
    psql -U postgres -d execution_console -c "UPDATE users SET password_hash = '$HASH' WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';"
  ```

  On a real install, another admin creates a new admin account instead.
