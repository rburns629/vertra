# Setting up Vertra

From an empty account to people running steps, with `vertra`, the installer.
It asks what it needs, shows what it will create and what that costs, and
changes nothing until you approve. Every answer is kept in
`deploy/<env>/vertra.yaml`, so `vertra apply` again makes the install match it,
and `vertra config set` changes one thing.

## Before you start

- **Where it runs.** Your laptop (`kind`, free), Google Cloud (`gcp`), AWS
  (`aws`), or a Kubernetes cluster you already have (`existing`). For a cloud,
  get the account ready first: [Google Cloud](clouds/gcp.md),
  [AWS](clouds/aws.md). For the catalog, [GitHub](clouds/github.md).
- **The tools.** `vertra tools --install` downloads what's missing (kubectl,
  helm, OpenTofu, kind), each pinned and checksum-verified. Docker is yours to
  install.

## 1. `vertra init <env>`

It asks, in order, with what each choice costs or gives up:

| Question | What it decides |
| --- | --- |
| Where | kind, gcp, aws or existing; the project, region or kubectl context |
| Size | how many copies of each part, and the step caps (`minimal` to `scaled`, or `auto`) |
| Sleep when idle | scale to zero after a quiet spell (data kept); `vertra wake` brings it back |
| Database | gcp, aws: in-cluster Postgres (backed up to a bucket), or managed: Cloud SQL or Amazon RDS, no passwords of Vertra's, the cloud's backups, a standby in a second zone if chosen ([Databases](operations.md#databases)) |
| First admin | their email; the password is generated and shown once after the first apply |
| The console | private (`vertra console` port-forwards to it) or reached over HTTPS at a hostname |
| The catalog | a GitHub repository for your teams' products, made for you |
| Log search | keep steps' logs for search in Observe (archived to a bucket after 30 days on a cloud) |
| The audit copy | gcp, aws: copy the audit log to a bucket that refuses deletes; locking it is a separate, permanent choice |
| The API gateway | serve the catalog's API products |
| Monitoring | Prometheus for alerts: the cluster's Prometheus Operator (kind, existing), GKE's managed Prometheus (gcp, a few dollars a month), Amazon Managed Prometheus with alerts emailed (aws, a few dollars a month), or one of its own (a Pod and a 2 GiB volume) ([Metrics and alerts](operations.md#metrics-and-alerts)) |

**A public console**, by target:

- **gcp**: a reserved address and a Google-managed certificate, on a free
  `nip.io` name or a hostname of yours.
- **aws**: a Route 53 zone vertra creates (e.g. `vertra.example.com`), which you
  delegate once with its NS records; the certificate and record are made for
  you.
- **existing**: your Ingress controller and a certificate from cert-manager
  (Let's Encrypt, or a ClusterIssuer of yours); vertra installs cert-manager if
  the cluster hasn't got it.

## 2. `vertra apply <env>`

It shows the plan: what it creates in your account, what it builds and
installs, and the estimated monthly cost. Nothing happens until you approve.
A first cloud install takes about ten to twenty minutes.

**DNS.** With a hostname of yours, apply says exactly which record to add
where your domain is managed, and waits for it:

```
Add this DNS record where example.com is managed:
  A     vertra.example.com → 34.57.221.133   (TTL 300)
```

Many DNS providers add the domain themselves: then the record's name is just
`vertra`. The certificate is issued once the name resolves; `vertra status`
shows both.

**The admin's password** is printed once at the end of the first apply. Sign
in with it and choose your own: nothing else opens until you do. If it's lost,
`vertra admin reset-password <env>` makes a new one, which then has to be
changed at the next sign-in.

## 3. Sign in, and invite people

Sign in at the console's address (or `vertra console <env>`, then
http://localhost:18080). On the Admin page, create accounts: each gets a
temporary password to change at their first sign-in, and starts in the teams
you choose.

**Signing in with Google** (Workspace accounts): `vertra sso google <env>`. It
says which two pages of the Google Cloud console to open and what to paste
there, then reads the file you download. `vertra apply` turns it on. Passwords
keep working; on a team's page, an admin can then require Google sign-in for
that team's members (admins can always use their password, in case Google
can't be reached). `vertra sso off` turns it off again.

## 4. The catalog

`vertra catalog create <env>` makes your catalog repository: its CI builds,
scans and signs your teams' products and releases them to every install that
reads the catalog. The [catalog's own guide](../catalog-template/README.md)
covers adding teams and products.

## Day to day

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `vertra status <env>` | what's installed, awake or asleep; a public console's address and certificate |
| `vertra console <env>` | reach the console from your machine |
| `vertra backup <env>` / `vertra backups <env>` | back up the databases now (`--to <folder>`: here); list the backups |
| `vertra restore <env> <time>` | replace the databases with a backup (`--from <folder>`); asks first |
| `vertra logs <env> [component] [-f]` | the platform's logs; `--execution <id>` for a run's steps |
| `vertra sleep` / `vertra wake <env>` | scale to zero and back (data kept) |
| `vertra config set -e <env> <key> <value>` | change a setting, then `vertra apply` |
| `vertra apply <env>` | upgrade, or make the install match the settings again |
| `vertra destroy <env>` | remove it; asks about data |
| `vertra help settings` / `vertra help sizes` | every setting, and what each size gets |
| `vertra man ~/.local/share/man` | write the man pages (`man vertra`); each release also attaches them, `vertra-man.tar.gz` |

**What `destroy` keeps.** Unless you choose to delete data: the database's
disk, the backups and logs buckets, and the task registry. The audit copy's
bucket is always kept: it's the record, and its retention refuses deletion
until it lapses. A local registry another kind cluster still uses is kept too.

**Upgrading.** The release an install runs is the `vertra` setting
(`vertra init --release <x.y.z>` chooses it; `source` builds your checkout
instead). To upgrade, `vertra config set -e <env> vertra <x.y.z>`, then
`vertra apply <env>`. Back up first: going back across a database
migration means restoring the databases, not just applying the older
release ([Rolling back](operations.md#rolling-back)).

  upgrades and rolling back, backups, monitoring, troubleshooting. Every
  chart setting, with its default, is documented in the charts'
  `values.yaml` (`helm/charts/execution-kernel/`,
  `helm/charts/execution-console/`).
