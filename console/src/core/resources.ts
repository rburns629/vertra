 * Who sees one: the team the run was for (or, for a run for nobody's team,

 * deleted once its step succeeds (resourceRecorder.ts).
 *
 * What depends on what (decision 25, resourceLinks): a resource others
 * still depend on isn't deleted on its own say. Deleting it is refused
 * (HAS_DEPENDENTS), recorded as a request, and the admins are alerted; it
 * runs once an admin approves the request. Deleting the dependents with it
 * needs no approval: they're deleted first.
