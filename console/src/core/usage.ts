 * Who ran what (ObserveService.GetUsage; Observe's Usage tab and the Teams
 * page): runs started for each team over a period, who started them, the
 * products their steps used, and the teams each team's products ran for.
 * From the console's own record of runs (submitted_executions), so it needs
 * no Prometheus; perf/README.md's phase 3 measured it at about 50 ms over
 * 200,000 runs. How runs ended is the kernel's, on Metrics.
 *
 * A run counts for the teams it was run for, as runView.ts decides who owns
 * it: a template run's onBehalfOf ("" when for no team), a raw DAG's every
 * team. Readiness checks (the console's own) don't count. Steps are the
 * steps of the DAG as submitted, retries not counted. A step is a product's
 * only when it ran in the product's team's namespace, where that team sees
 * it (runView.ts); elsewhere it's an image, by its repository.
 *
 * Every install's whole usage is read once a minute per period, grouped by
 * the set of teams each run counts for (so a run for two teams is still one
 * run in a total), and each caller is shown their part of it: an admin
 * every team; anyone else the teams they're in, the products those teams
 * own (and every team that used them, as each such run is already theirs to
 * see in part), and the products their teams used.
