 * Teams and their lifecycle: the logic behind TeamService.
 *
 * Creating a team is a platform-level action: only a platform admin, or an
 * automation token holding teams:create (auth/scopes.ts), or the
 * catalog's release (catalogSync.ts). A team is also a Kubernetes namespace tasks are
 * dispatched into, so it isn't something any registered user may mint.
 *
 * The creator is deliberately not made a member. Admins already reach every
 * team, and making catalog CI a member of every team it created was how one
 * leaked CI token came to control every platform, back when CI called the
 * console. A new team starts empty;
 * an admin adds its first members. Growing it stays self-service within the
 * team: a member, or an admin, can add another.
