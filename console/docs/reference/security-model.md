# Security model

How Vertra keeps each team's secrets to that team's reviewed products: what's
enforced today, by which layer, what isn't enforced yet, and what's out of
scope. Written for security reviewers evaluating Vertra, and kept honest:
where something is a plan rather than a fact, it says so.

Last reviewed 2026-10-18, for 0.x. Vertra is not production-ready yet; the
gaps in [Not yet enforced](#not-yet-enforced) are why.

## At a glance

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Where do secret values live? | In Kubernetes Secrets, in the owning team's namespace. Synced secrets keep their source of truth in the team's own store (GCP Secret Manager and others, through External Secrets Operator). |
| Does Vertra's database store secret values? | No. The console stores which secrets each team registered, and the names of their keys, never values. The kernel never sees them. |
| Who can read a secret? | Steps of its team's registered products that list it in `secretRefs`, and cluster administrators. Not the console: it writes Secrets but has no right to read them. See [Who can read a secret](#who-can-read-a-secret). |
| Can one team's step reach another team's secret? | No. A step runs in its own team's namespace, and a Pod can only mount Secrets from its own namespace. |
| Can one product reach another product's secret in the same team? | By design, yes: a team's secrets are the team's, and the team chooses per step which ones it gets (`secretRefs`). What a team can't do is give one to an image that isn't its registered product (it runs with no secrets), or mount a Secret it never registered. The console checks this at submit time, and an admission policy makes the cluster enforce it on every step's Job. A product's own cloud identity (its declared ServiceAccount) is still its own: another product can't run as it. |
| Can a team register another team's product, or its image, as its own? | No. A product name and an image repository belong to the first team that registers them, the repository even after its products are deleted (an admin can release an unused one). Catalog CI also derives each image's path from its team's folder, so one team can't publish under another's name. |
| Can anything but the console submit work? | No. kernel-api accepts only the console's ServiceAccount token, issued for kernel-api alone and checked with a TokenReview. See [How kernel-api knows its caller](#how-kernel-api-knows-its-caller). |
| Is anything enforced if the console is bypassed? | Yes: which namespaces steps may run in, which image sources they may use, image signatures (with Sigstore's policy-controller installed) and who may delete a team namespace. These are admission policies the Kubernetes API server applies. |
| Are secrets encrypted at rest? | That depends on the cluster. Enabling encryption of Secrets at rest in etcd, ideally with a KMS provider, is the cluster operator's responsibility and a prerequisite for production. |
| What reaches logs and outputs? | Whatever a step prints or returns. Vertra stores step outputs and logs; a product must never print or return a secret. |

## Who is trusted

| Actor | Trusted to | Limited by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cluster administrators | Everything; they can read any Secret | Outside Vertra's control |
| Vertra admins (console) | Manage teams, people, bots, allowed image sources; act in any team | Console authorization; every admin action is logged |
| Catalog reviewers | Decide which product images exist, and which ServiceAccount and secrets each product declares | The catalog repository's review rules (CODEOWNERS, protected branches) |
| Team maintainers | Manage their team: its people and their roles, register its secrets and choose which step gets which, its bots, raw DAGs, cancelling its runs | Console authorization (`auth/access.ts`): the maintainer role, per-product identity, registered team secrets |
| Team members | See their team's runs, logs, Pods and secrets' names; run its actions and what's shared with it | The member role: nothing they can change |
| Product images | Do their one job with the inputs and secrets they're given | Their namespace, ServiceAccount and mounted secrets; admission policies |
| Pipelines (bots) | What their token's scopes allow; an ordering bot, only its listed templates | Scoped, hashed API tokens; `auth/access.ts`'s `ensureMayOrder` |

## Where secret values live

A secret enters in one of two ways, and ends up the same way:

1. **Pasted** on the console's Secrets tab. The value passes through the
   console in the request and is written straight into a Kubernetes Secret in
   the team's namespace (`console/src/k8s.ts`). It isn't stored in the console's
   database or written to its logs (request logging records method, URL and
   status, not bodies).
2. **Synced** from a team's own store. The console creates an ExternalSecret,
   which is only a reference; External Secrets Operator reads the value with the
   team's SecretStore identity and writes the Kubernetes Secret. The console
   never holds the value. SecretStores themselves arrive through a reviewed
   catalog pull request (in the catalog's release, which the console pulls
   and verifies), never from the console's own UI.

Either way, the console **registers** it for the team (`secret_grants`): the
secret's name and its key names. Only registered secrets can be mounted, and
only by the team's registered products.

- The console labels what it creates (`app.kubernetes.io/managed-by:
  vertra-console`) and won't replace, or register, a Secret it didn't
  create, such as a SecretStore's own credentials: that's refused with a 409.
  So a SecretStore's credentials can never be mounted by a step.
- No RBAC is involved: mounting doesn't consult it, and steps don't read
  Secrets through the API. The console creates no Roles (older versions made
  one per secret; the console removes them at startup).
- Revoking a secret (Team page, or `SecretService/RevokeSecret`)
  removes the registration and the Secret or ExternalSecret the console
  created. Tasks already running keep what they mounted.

### What a secret can hold

A secret is a set of named keys, each mounted as a file at
`/platform/secrets/<secret>/<key>`; Vertra doesn't interpret the values.
Typical shapes: one opaque value under `value` (an API key, a webhook
signing secret); a credential in several keys of one secret (`clientId` and
`clientSecret`, `username` and `password`, `tls.crt` and `tls.key`); or a
whole credential file under one key, for a platform with no federation to
use instead. Prefer workload identity wherever the target supports it: then
there's no secret at all.

A step that has a credential sends it to the service it authenticates to;
these rules decide which step can have it, where (one Pod) and for how long
(that process), not whether the credential exists. Short-lived credentials
(workload identity, a vault's dynamic secrets) are what shorten that window.

### Syncing secrets from a vault

A team that keeps its secrets in a vault (GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key
Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, 1Password) syncs them through
External Secrets Operator, an optional component. Two objects, provisioned
by different people on purpose:

| Object | Says | Who creates it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SecretStore** | This namespace may read this vault, as this identity: a scope grant | The team proposes it in the catalog (`teams/<team>/secret-stores/`); catalog admins approve; the console applies it after checking it only names a store in the team's namespace, ESO's own ServiceAccounts, and, for a store that needs a stored credential, the Secret `eso-auth` |
| **ExternalSecret** | Sync this key from that store into this Secret: a reference | Team members, self-service, on the Secrets tab |

So a team can sync as many secrets as it likes without ever widening what
its store can reach. And a store's cloud identity is its team's alone: the
console records the Google service account, AWS role or Azure identity each
team's stores sign in as (their ESO ServiceAccounts' bindings, and a role a
store assumes) and refuses another team's store naming one
(`IDENTITY_IN_USE`; the catalog's `secret-stores check` says so in the pull
request). A binding made only on the cloud's side (a Workload Identity
principal for the namespace, say) isn't in the file, so keeping that one per
team is the cloud administrator's. Both are namespaced (never a ClusterSecretStore): an
ExternalSecret can't use another namespace's store, even applied by hand. A
store's own credential (for a vault that can't federate, such as a
1Password service account token) is set per install by a team member or
admin (Team page → Secrets → Stored credential, `TeamService/
SetSecretStoreCredential`), never carried by the catalog; it's written to
`eso-auth`, and can never be registered or mounted by a step. A synced secret rotates on the vault's side, with no
change in Vertra.

| Vault | Sign-in | Stored credential | Proven |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GCP Secret Manager | GKE Workload Identity | None | Yes |
| Azure Key Vault | AKS Workload Identity | None | Not yet (`catalog-template/samples/azure`) |
| AWS Secrets Manager | IRSA (the cluster's OIDC issuer registered in IAM) | None | Yes (2026-10-27, EKS) |
| HashiCorp Vault | Vault's Kubernetes auth | None | Not yet |
| 1Password | A service account token | One, in `eso-auth` | Not yet |

## How a secret reaches a step

1. A team submits a DAG through the console. Each step names its team
   (its namespace) and any `secretRefs`; its `serviceAccount` is optional,
   filled in with its product's own (or `default`).
2. The console checks, before anything runs
   (`console/src/core/executions.ts`):
   - the caller maintains every team named, or is an admin;
   - the step runs as the ServiceAccount its product declares in the catalog,
     or as `default`; only a registered product may mount secrets at all;
   - each secret in `secretRefs` is registered for the step's team.
     (An action's `secretRefs` in product.yaml are recorded as its bindings;
     they don't restrict yet. Once consumers run templates, each step will
     use its action's own.)

   The console reads these fields by their documented names (`serviceAccount`,
   `secretRefs`), and builds kernel-api's request from exactly those names,
   refusing any other (`service_account`, `secret_refs`;
   `console/src/kernel/client.ts`): otherwise a submission could show the
   console one identity and give the kernel another.

   Retries and reruns are checked again against current memberships and
   secrets.
3. The kernel starts the step as a Kubernetes Job in that namespace, running
   as that ServiceAccount, with each secret mounted read-only at
   `/platform/secrets/<name>/`. The kernel itself has no permission to read
   Secrets.

Mounting happens through the kubelet, which doesn't consult the Pod's RBAC. That
is why this check exists: RBAC can't stop any Pod in the namespace from
mounting any Secret there. The console makes it in step 2, and the
cluster makes it again when the scheduler creates the Job (the identity
policy, below), so it holds even for a Job the console never checked.

## Consumers and templates

Running a team's template (`TemplateService`) needs no membership of the
teams its steps run in. Who may run one: its team's members, admins, and
whoever its `shareWith` covers (everyone, `*`, or members of the teams it
lists, who then run it on behalf of one of them). What runs is built by the
console from the registered products its steps name
(`console/src/core/templates.ts`): each step's image, ServiceAccount,
secrets (its action's `secretRefs`), token audiences and namespace are the
product's; the person running it supplies parameters, checked against the
template's schema, and nothing else. A step of another team's action needs
that action shared with the template's team: the team whose identity does
the work consents through its `shareWith`, checked by catalog CI, when a
release is applied (such a template isn't stored), on every run and on
every retry. Then every check a submission gets applies (identity,
registered secrets, images, scans), and the cluster's policies hold as for
any Job.

Where another team may aim a team's products is the owning team's: an
input typed as a target (`x-vertra-needs: gcp.project`, `gcp.folder`,
`aws.account`, `azure.subscription`) must match its team.yaml's
`allowedTargets` for the running team, or the run is refused before it
starts (`TARGET_NOT_ALLOWED`, `console/src/targets.ts`). The owning team's
own runs aren't limited. A value another step will produce isn't known at
submit: the input schema the console attaches for the kernel is narrowed to
the patterns the rules allow without an approval, so the kernel refuses
any other value once it's resolved, before the step starts
(`INPUT_INVALID`); with none allowed, the run is refused at submit. That
matters since carts (decision 25) let a member wire any product that
provides a target type into another team's (since 2026-10-28; before, a
step's output went unchecked). The identity's cloud permissions, scoped to
the same folders, hold if the console's check is ever bypassed.

The chat agent (decision 24, `console/src/chat/`) acts as the person
asking: each tool calls the console's own code with their identity, so it
sees what they may, and its only effect is a proposed cart, which they open
and place themselves. Ordering bots can't use it. Its answers' citations
are kept only when they name a section it retrieved, and links are the
console's, not the model's. It answers only about Vertra: a question
judged not about it (by a separate, tool-less call that treats the
question as data) gets a fixed sentence and never reaches the agent, and an
answer resting on neither the docs it cites nor its tools' results is
replaced, so neither a question that talks it out of its instructions nor
the model's memory can put an answer in front of someone. A conversation
is bounded by `chat.contextTokens`. What's asked, and what its tools return, goes to
the install's chat model (`chat.endpoint`); nothing is kept by the console,
except an answer someone rates: its question, answer, sources and their
comment, for the admins only (`ChatService/RateAnswer`, a rating for a
team only by its members), deleted after 90 days.

A member checks out a cart as one run for their team (`OrderService/
PlaceOrder`, `console/src/core/orders.ts`): each step is an action shared
with them, run as it would be alone (its product's image, identity and
secrets, its targets checked as above), so it's no more than they could run
step by step; no raw DAG, and ordering bots still order templates only.

A team can also make a step wait for a person (approvals): product.yaml's
`approval` (`always`, or `otherTeams` for another team's runs), or an
`allowedTargets` rule's `approval: true`. The console marks such a step
`approvalRequired` (a submitter can't set or clear it), and the kernel holds
it in `AWAITING_APPROVAL`, never claimed, until a maintainer of the step's
team approves it. The person who submitted the run can't decide, even as a
maintainer, so two people agree before it runs (`console/src/core/
approvals.ts`). Each decision is in the audit log and, with who decided, in
the step's events; a declined or expired step fails (`APPROVAL_DECLINED`,
`APPROVAL_EXPIRED`), and retrying it asks again. The check is the console's:
kernel-api trusts its caller, as it does for everything else.

A raw DAG needs a maintainer of every team it names. The run belongs to
whoever ran it as well as to its steps' teams: they may see, cancel, retry
and rerun it (a rerun runs the template again, as it is now; a retry is
refused once it, or a step's action, is no longer shared).

## Who sees a run that spans teams

A template run can have steps in several teams' namespaces: the team it was
run for (its consumer) and the teams whose products it uses (its
providers). Its owners (admins, whoever submitted it, members of the team
it was run for; for a raw DAG, every team in it) see every step, so a
consumer sees what each provider's step returned. A provider's member sees
their own team's steps in full and, of the rest, only each step's product,
state, timing and failure code: never its inputs, outputs, failure message,
the run's template parameters or its logs (`console/src/core/runView.ts`,
in the run's details, its events and logs, and Observe's log search).

## What a run made, and deleting it

A step lists what it made in its outputs' `resources`; the console keeps
each one (`resources`), with that step's inputs and outputs, after the run
is gone (`console/src/core/resources.ts`). Its type, id, name and link are
seen by the team it was made for, whoever ran it, the team whose product
made it, and admins; the stored inputs and outputs are never shown, only
used to fill in its cleanup's inputs. A resource keeps the team and person
it was first made for: another run reporting the same one (say, a create
that only found it) doesn't make it theirs, unless it had been deleted.
Deleting one (the team it was made for, whoever ran it, admins) runs that product's current `cleanup` action
as a run of its own, with every check a run of that action gets: it must
be shared with the person, its inputs fit its schema, its targets be
allowed, and its approval waits for a maintainer. Asking for a delete is in
the audit log, and so is the run.

## Notifications and chat webhooks

People see their own notifications only. A team's chat webhook URL (Slack,
Google Chat, Teams) is a credential the console has to use, so it's the
one third-party credential the console keeps itself, by decision: encrypted
in its database (AES-256-GCM, with a key derived from its `JWT_SECRET`, so
a copy of the database alone doesn't give it away), never sent back by the
API (members see its host), set only by the team's maintainers (audited,
without the URL), and only under the hosts the install allows
(`notifications.webhookHosts`: Slack's, Google Chat's and Teams' by
default), over HTTPS, without following redirects, so a webhook can't
point the console at anything inside the cluster. A post says what
happened and links to the console; it carries no outputs or logs.
Rotating `JWT_SECRET` makes the stored URLs unreadable, and teams set
theirs again.

## Email

When an install sends email (the console chart's `notifications.email`),
the console sends notifications through its SMTP server, to each person
for the kinds they choose, to their account's address. The server's
password is a Secret the console mounts as a file and reads itself; it's
never in an environment variable, the database or a log. Emails say what
happened and link to the console, as the inbox does: no outputs or logs.

## Keyless bots

A bot can sign in with its CI job's own OIDC identity instead of a stored
token, so a pipeline holds no Vertra secret. A team's maintainers bind a
bot to an issuer the install allows (`keyless.issuers`: GitHub Actions and
gitlab.com by default) and exact claims: one naming the repository or
subject, perhaps the branch or environment; no patterns, and never `aud`
or `iss`, which are checked anyway. `AuthService/ExchangeToken` verifies the
token's signature with the issuer's published keys (an issuer not on the
list is never contacted), its issuer, its audience (`keyless.audience`,
the console's URL by default, so a token minted for another service can't
be replayed here) and expiry, and returns an hour's ordinary session for
the one bot whose claims it carries; two or none is a refusal. Each sign-in
is logged with the bot, issuer and subject, and the identity's last use is
kept.

## Ordering bots

An *ordering bot* (decision 23: a storefront or another system placing
orders) is a member of its team, not a maintainer, and may run only the
templates its team's maintainers list for it: no raw DAG, no single action,
no rerun (`ORDERS_ONLY`, `TEMPLATE_NOT_ORDERABLE`). A leaked ordering token
can order those templates for that team, under its caps, quota and
approvals, and nothing more, and at most the install's rate a minute
(`orders.ratePerMinute`, 60 by default; 429 past it, counted from the runs it
made, so every console replica agrees). The runs a schedule makes as its bot
aren't limited this way: the schedule is its team's, reviewed by its maintainers.

An ordering bot may have a callback, where each of its orders' outcomes is
posted, and a team an outcome webhook, where each of its runs' outcomes is
(`console/src/callbacks.ts`). Like a team's chat webhook, its URL
is sealed with a key derived from `JWT_SECRET`, never sent back, only under
the hosts the install allows (the console chart's `orders.callbackHosts`,
none by default) and never redirected. Each post is signed with the bot's own
secret (HMAC-SHA256 over the time and the body, `Vertra-Signature`), shown
once when it's made, so the receiver can refuse forged and replayed posts. A
bot's post says which run and order it was and how it ended, never its
outputs: those are read with `GetExecution`, as the bot. A team's carries
its steps' outputs, as its members see them on the run's page: so a team
sets one only where it would show those outputs (which never hold
credentials, the product contract).

## Schedules

A schedule runs as one of its team's bots, never as the person who made it:
a maintainer picks the bot, and the console starts each run as that bot,
with the bot's teams and roles as they are then, through the same checks
as the bot running it itself (sharing, the parameters' schema, targets,
approvals). A bot that loses access stops the schedule at its next run,
which is refused, kept on the schedule and told to the team's maintainers.
Deleting the bot deletes its schedules.

## Who sees a step's logs

A step's output is stored (the kernel redacts recognizable credentials
first) and shown by level (decided 2026-10-21, `console/src/logLevels.ts`):
lines the step logs as JSON with `"level": "info"` to everyone who can see
the run; every other line (debug, warn, error, and any plain line, so
nothing reaches a consumer by accident) only to the step's team and admins.
A consumer sees how many lines were held back and which team sees them.

Observe's log search (the console chart's `logs`, off by default) keeps the
same rule over Loki, which has no users of its own: the console adds the
caller's visibility to every query (`console/src/core/logs.ts`), and Loki
accepts only the collector's pushes and the console's queries
(NetworkPolicy). The collector, Grafana Alloy, redacts credentials before
anything is stored, with the kernel's patterns, and may read every Pod's
logs in the cluster (a read-only ClusterRole on `pods` and `pods/log`:
steps run in every team's namespace); it keeps only steps' Pods and the
platform's own. The platform's own logs are for admins only.

## The API gateway

API products (decision 20) publish a team's own backend through one
gateway (`gateway/`). The gateway forwards a request only when its method
and path are an operation in the API's reviewed OpenAPI document and it fits
that operation's schemas; anything else is answered by the gateway (404 or
400) and never reaches the backend. Callers sign in as at the console (a
session or a bot token, checked against the console's database the same
way), and may call an API only when it's shared with one of their teams.
The caller's `Authorization` stops at the gateway; the backend gets its own
credential instead, minted per request, and `Vertra-Caller`, an EdDSA JWT
the gateway signs (its key at `/.vertra/jwks.json`) naming the caller,
their team and the API. A caller's own `Vertra-*` headers are dropped.
Paths with encoded slashes or dot segments are refused, so what's checked
is what's forwarded.

Backends must be under hosts the admins allow (`gateway.backendHosts`), or
the API is held: the gateway can't be pointed anywhere a catalog says. Its
only Kubernetes right is minting ServiceAccount tokens, and an admission
policy limits that to API ServiceAccounts (`*-api`) in team namespaces, so
it can't mint the platform's or a team's other identities. It reads the
console's database and never writes it. Requests are logged and counted by
API, team, caller and outcome, never with bodies, header values or
credentials; the counts kept for each API's page (`api_traffic`, a week)
hold only the calling team, never who. What it refused there is also in
Observe's refusals, seen by the API's team, the calling team and admins
(by the API's team and admins alone when no calling team is known). Its egress excludes the cloud
metadata server, so no backend URL can reach the node's credentials
through it, and it reads no Secrets: a backend that takes only a static
key can't be published.

## Tokens for another cloud

A step can sign in to a cloud other than the one hosting the cluster by
OIDC federation (AWS web identity, Entra workload identity, a GCP workload
identity pool), with a ServiceAccount token issued for that cloud. A
product asks for one by declaring its audiences (`tokenAudiences` in
`product.yaml`); a submitter can't choose them, as they can't choose a
ServiceAccount.

- The kernel mounts one projected token per declared audience at
  `/platform/tokens/<audience>` (characters outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` become
  `_`), each issued for that audience only and lasting an hour; the kubelet
  renews them. Steps still get no Kubernetes API token.
- The console refuses, at registration, any audience that would make the
  token good inside this cluster: the Kubernetes API server's (read from
  the console's own API token's `aud` claim) and kernel-api's
  (`console/src/tokenAudiences.ts`).
- The identity policy refuses a Job with a token for any audience its
  product didn't declare, or one lasting over an hour, so it holds for a
  Job the console never checked.

What the token is good for is the cloud's decision: trust the cluster's
issuer for the specific ServiceAccount (`system:serviceaccount:<team>:<sa>`),
never for the whole issuer.

## How kernel-api knows its caller

kernel-api knows nothing about users or teams; it acts on whatever the
console asks, because the console has already authorized it. So it checks
one thing on every call: that the caller is the console
(`kernel/internal/api/auth.go`).

- The console's Pod gets its ServiceAccount token projected for the
  audience `vertra-kernel-api` (rotated by the kubelet, valid an hour), so
  the token is useless against the Kubernetes API or anything else.
- kernel-api asks the API server whose token it is (a TokenReview, for that
  audience) and accepts only the ServiceAccounts in
  `api.auth.allowedServiceAccounts`. kernel-api's own ServiceAccount holds
  only the built-in `system:auth-delegator` role needed for that.
- No token, or one for another audience: 401. A valid token from anyone
  else, such as a step's own ServiceAccount: 403. Proven on kind.
- A successful review is reused for up to 60 seconds, so a revoked token
  can stay accepted that long. If the API server can't be asked, the
  request fails.

`/health` and `/metrics` stay open for probes and scrapers; they carry no
execution data. Every metrics port (kernel-api's, the scheduler's, the
console's and the gateway's) accepts only `networkPolicy.metricsFrom`, so a
step can't read them, and no metric is labelled with a user, a team or a
token.

## The console's writes

The console can't read a Secret. It creates, replaces and deletes them (and
product ServiceAccounts, ExternalSecrets, SecretStores and each team's
default-deny NetworkPolicy) through a cluster-wide role, which an admission
policy, the write fence (`write-fence-policy.yaml`), confines to namespaces
labelled as teams'. The console can't change that policy or its binding,
and it checks both are in force (failing closed, bound to deny) before it
starts: without them it refuses to start, since its role would otherwise
reach every namespace. Per-namespace RoleBindings were considered and
dropped: the console would have to create them, and only the same policy
would keep it from binding the role elsewhere.

## Signing in

People sign in with a password, or with single sign-on when it's on: an
OpenID Connect provider (Google, Entra ID, Okta, Keycloak) that either the
console chart's `sso` sets (then it's read-only in the console) or admins
set on Admin, People (`console/src/core/sso.ts`; its client secret sealed
in the database with a key derived from `JWT_SECRET`, write-only). Saving
a provider reads its discovery document first. Every console reads the
saved settings every few seconds, so turning it on or off needs no restart
(`console/src/sso.ts`, `console/src/auth/oidc.ts`). The sign-in uses the authorization code flow
with PKCE; its state, nonce and verifier live in a signed, HttpOnly cookie
for ten minutes. The ID token must carry the provider's signature, this
console as its audience, this sign-in's nonce, a verified email, and a
Workspace domain listed in `sso.allowedDomains` (a personal Google account
has none, so it can't sign in). The first sign-in binds the account to the
provider's identity (`users.oidc_subject`): from then on, a different
provider account given the same email is refused. The session comes back in
the URL's fragment, which browsers never send to a server.

Turning single sign-on on changes nothing else: passwords still work. A team
an admin sets to require it (`teams.require_sso`) refuses its members'
passwords (checked only after the password itself, so the refusal says
nothing to someone guessing) and every session a password made, at the
console and the gateway alike; sessions say which they are. Someone in
several teams must use single sign-on if any requires it, since a password
would open the strict team's runs and secrets too. Admins are exempt, as the
way in if the provider fails. While single sign-on is off the setting has
no effect, so nobody is locked out. Bots keep their tokens.

Groups, from the ID token's groups claim and/or Google Workspace (Cloud
Identity's Groups API, read as the console's own Google service account,
which a Workspace admin makes a Groups Reader; it asks only whether the
person is in each mapped Google group), can be mapped to teams by admins. At each
single sign-on, every mapped team's membership follows the person's groups:
added with the best role their groups give, changed, or removed. Teams
nothing maps to are left alone. Google Workspace groups are also read again
every hour for everyone who signs in with single sign-on, so leaving one
takes someone out of its team within the hour (a person whose groups can't
be read then keeps their teams until the next try). Groups that can't be read (a missing claim,
too many groups for the token, Google's API failing) refuse the sign-in
(`GROUPS_UNAVAILABLE`) rather than count as none, which would take people
out of their teams. On a mapped team, a single sign-on member's membership
can't be changed by hand (`TEAM_FOLLOWS_SSO_GROUPS`); bots and password
accounts are managed there as ever.

A password someone else set (a new account's temporary one, an admin's
reset of someone else's, `vertra admin reset-password`) has to be changed
before anything else: until then its session may only read who it is and
change it (`PASSWORD_CHANGE_REQUIRED`), and the gateway refuses it.

## In the browser

The console sends a Content-Security-Policy on every response: scripts only
from its own origin, no plugins, and it can't be framed (`frame-ancestors
'none'`), plus `nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options` and HSTS. The session token sits
in `localStorage`, so the policy matters: it's what stops an injected script
from running at all. Styles may be inline, because the UI library injects
them. Checked in a real browser (headless Chrome, every signed-in page: no
violations).

## Who can read a secret

- **Steps of the team's registered products that list it** in `secretRefs`,
  through the mounted files. Steps get no API access to Secrets.
- **Not the console.** Its role can create, replace and delete Secrets, but
  not read them (no `get` or `list`): whether a Secret is a team's comes
  from its own records. Its writes are fenced to team namespaces (below),
  and it can't grant RBAC (it may only delete Roles, never create them). A
  compromised console could still write a team's secret values, so it
  remains the most privileged component and should be treated that way.
- **Nobody, for the registry pull Secret.** With the console chart's
  `registryCheck.copyToTeams` on, the console copies the platform's
  registry credential into every team namespace as `vertra-pull`, and the
  kernel names it as every step Pod's `imagePullSecret`
  (`scheduler.taskImagePullSecret`). Only the kubelet uses it: the name is
  reserved, so it can never be registered as a team secret and mounted.
  The console has it as a mounted file and rewrites every team's copy on
  each policy resync, so a rotation reaches every team within one
  interval. Turning the option off leaves the copies; delete them by hand.
  Reading another cloud's Artifact Registry (`registryCheck.gcpFederation`),
  the copy is a token the console minted that hour by Workload Identity
  Federation, renewed every resync; it reads the catalog's repository and
  nothing else, and lapses within the hour once the provider is deleted.
- **Cluster administrators**, and anyone else the cluster's own RBAC lets read
  Secrets in a team namespace. Vertra doesn't grant people Kubernetes
  access, but doesn't prevent a cluster operator from doing so.

## Guardrails the cluster enforces

These are ValidatingAdmissionPolicies (and, optionally, Sigstore's
policy-controller), so they hold even for a request that reaches the kernel
without going through the console:

| Guardrail | What it refuses | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dispatch namespaces | Jobs in any namespace not labelled `vertra/team=true`, and in the platform's own namespace (`DISPATCH_REJECTED`) | `helm/charts/execution-kernel/templates/dispatch-policy.yaml` |
| Image sources | Images outside the allowed registries (`IMAGE_NOT_ALLOWED`) | `templates/image-policy.yaml` |
| Image signatures | Unsigned images, where policy-controller is installed (`IMAGE_NOT_SIGNED`) | `templates/image-signature.yaml` |
| Image scans | An image not pinned by digest (`IMAGE_NOT_PINNED`), or one whose digest failed its security scan unless an admin accepted it (`IMAGE_SCAN_FAILED`). The console scans every image before it's registered or run, and daily while in use | `templates/scan-policy.yaml` |
| Step identity | A step running as any ServiceAccount but `default` unless it's a registered product running as the one its `product.yaml` declares; any step mounting a Secret unless it's a registered product and the Secret is registered for its team; Secrets reaching a step any way but a volume (`IDENTITY_NOT_ALLOWED`). The console keeps the policy's products and team secrets current. | `templates/identity-policy.yaml` |
| Team deletion | A configured purger deleting a team namespace that isn't labelled retired. None is configured by default: the console leaves a purged team's namespace, labelled retired, for a cluster administrator to delete, so the identity that retires a namespace can't also delete it (`teamNamespaces.purge` would let it) | `templates/purge-policy.yaml` |
| Console namespaces | The console creating a namespace that isn't labelled a team's, adopting one that isn't a team's, changing anything about a team namespace but its team label, or touching kube-* or the platform's own | console chart, `templates/namespace-policy.yaml` |
| Console write fence | The console's ServiceAccount creating, changing or deleting Secrets, ServiceAccounts, Roles, RoleBindings or ExternalSecrets outside team namespaces (kube-system, the platform's own) | console chart, `templates/write-fence-policy.yaml` |

An install `vertra` makes sets up signing itself when its catalog is signed
(`signing` in vertra.yaml, asked at `vertra init`): `kms`, a key in the
cloud's KMS (a GCP key ring with a fresh suffix, or an AWS ECC P-256 key)
that only the catalog repository's CI, through its main-only federation, may
sign with, its public half read at apply; or `keyless`, the repository's
`ci.yml` on main by GitHub's OIDC issuer, through Sigstore's public log
(which names the repository). Either way it installs policy-controller,
scoped to team namespaces and bound to an identity that may only read the
task registry, gives the kernel's imageSignature and the console's
catalog.signature the same signer, and sets the repository's
VERTRA_SIGNING_* variables. Proven on GKE (2026-10-26), both modes: CI
signed images and releases; the console applied only signed releases ("no
trusted signer signed the catalog release … nothing was applied" for one
pushed unsigned); a signed starter ran and an image pushed by hand, unsigned,
was refused (`IMAGE_NOT_SIGNED`). Proven on EKS too (2026-10-26), `kms`:
an AWS KMS key, with policy-controller reading ECR through Pod Identity; the
same four results.

An install reading another's catalog (`externalCatalog`) holds no signing
right: it trusts the owner's signer (`catalogSignature`: its public key, or
its repository's keyless identity) and, on gcp and aws, enforces it on
releases and images the same way, its policy-controller reading the
owner's registry. A catalog version (decision 22) is a tag on a release
main already signed, so it needs no signature of its own, and the tag's
own CI run holds no credential: it asks main to make it.

Two platform identities only change replica counts, through the scale
subresource (which can't change what a Deployment runs), on Deployments
named in their Roles: the kernel's sleeper (`scaleDown`, the platform's
own Deployments, plus its own `-sleep` ConfigMap and a read of the
console's `-activity` one) and the console (only the image scanner's, to
idle it, and its own `-activity` ConfigMap). A stolen token of either can
stop the platform, not change it.

And at the network level, NetworkPolicies (`templates/networkpolicy.yaml` in both charts) let only the platform's own Pods connect to its Postgres, and only the console connect to kernel-api: a step's Pod can reach neither. Every team namespace also holds `vertra-default-deny`, which the console writes with the namespace and rewrites on every policy resync (`console/src/teamNetwork.ts`): its Pods accept connections only from Pods in the same namespace, so one team's steps can't reach another team's Pods or Services. With the gateway on, it also writes `vertra-gateway-ingress`: the gateway's Pods (this release's namespace and the gateway's own labels) may reach the Pods the team labels `vertra/api-backend: "true"`, its API products' in-cluster backends, and nothing else of the team's (proven on kind 2026-10-28: through the gateway, 200; from another team's namespace, no connection; from its own namespace without the gateway's signed `Vertra-Caller`, the sample backend's 401). The console's write fence accepts no other NetworkPolicy from it, and only those two shapes (a broader selector, any namespace, any Pod of the platform's, or an extra peer is refused), and its RBAC can't delete one, so a compromised console can't open a team namespace up. Outgoing traffic isn't restricted: steps call their clouds. Every team namespace also holds a ResourceQuota (`vertra-team-quota`) and LimitRange (`vertra-team-limits`) when limits are set (`console/src/teamQuota.ts`: the chart's `teamNamespaces.quota`, or a team's own set by an admin), so one team's steps can't take the cluster's capacity from the others; the cluster refuses a Pod over them, and the write fence accepts no other quota or limits from the console. They need a CNI that enforces NetworkPolicy, and they select Pods by label, so creating Pods in the platform namespace must stay limited to administrators. The bundled databases' passwords are generated on install.

## What Vertra stores

| Where | What | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Console database | Users (argon2id password hashes), teams, memberships, bots (hashed API tokens), registered secrets (names and key names, no values), products, a record of submitted executions including their DAG, and what runs made (each resource with its step's resolved inputs and outputs) | Sessions are signed tokens that expire (8 hours by default). What runs made is kept past run retention, until it's deleted |
| Kernel database | Each execution's DAG, step inputs (as submitted and as resolved), outputs, logs and events | Never put a secret in a step's `inputs`: inputs are stored and shown to the execution's viewers. When the console's database shares this Postgres instance (`postgres.consoleDatabase`), the console signs in as its own role, which owns only its database and is refused a connection to the kernel's |
| Team namespace | A ConfigMap per step attempt holding its `request.json` (its resolved inputs), deleted with the step's Job | Readable by anyone with ConfigMap access in that namespace |

## Rules for product authors

Products are written by catalog contributors, not by Vertra, so these are
requirements on product code:

- **Never print or return a secret.** Logs and `result.json` outputs are stored
  and shown to everyone who can see the execution. The kernel catches the
  common mistakes (`kernel/internal/domain/credentials.go`): it redacts
  well-known credential shapes from logs and error messages (PEM private
  keys, AWS/Google/Azure keys, GitHub, Slack and Stripe tokens, bearer
  tokens, JWTs), fails a step whose outputs contain one
  (`OUTPUT_CONTAINS_CREDENTIAL`), and refuses a submission whose inputs do
  (`INPUT_CONTAINS_CREDENTIAL`). It can only recognize shapes, not values
  (it never sees a secret's value), so a password or an opaque token is
  still stored if printed. Log what you did, not what you used.
- **Be idempotent.** Steps run at least once: a retried step must not create
  something twice or charge twice.
- **Read secrets only from `/platform/secrets/`**, never from inputs, and never
  bake one into an image. Images are shared, cached and pulled by every team.

## Not yet enforced

Known gaps in 0.x, all tracked in [`TODO.md`](../TODO.md). They're the reason
Vertra isn't production-ready yet.

| Gap | Impact | Plan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The console can still create and replace Secrets in any team namespace | A compromised console could plant or overwrite a team's secret values (it can't read them) | Bind its Secret rights per team namespace as teams are created |
| Groups from an ID token's claim are read at sign-in only | Someone who leaves a group the provider reports in its token stays in its team until their session ends (8 hours by default) or they sign in again; Google Workspace groups are read again every hour | Shorter sessions where that matters (`JWT_TTL`) |
| The audit log lives in the console's own database unless `audit.export` copies it to write-once storage (its entries are hash-chained, so a change shows at the next copy; Observe shows the log as each caller may see it) | Someone who can write that database could change it | Ship the `event: "audit"` log lines to a SIEM or write-once store |
| Any member of one team in a multi-team execution can read all of its outputs (its steps' logs are filtered by level: other teams see INFO lines only) | Cross-team visibility of outputs within shared executions | Decide: filter outputs by team, or require every team for reads |

## Out of scope

- **A malicious product a reviewer approved.** Review, scanning and signing
  reduce this risk; a product that passes them runs with whatever its
  ServiceAccount and the secrets its team's steps give it allow.
- **A compromised cluster administrator, node or control plane.**
- **Side channels between Pods on the same node.**
- **The security of a team's own secret store** and of the identities it trusts.
